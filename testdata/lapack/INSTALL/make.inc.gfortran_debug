#  Modify the FORTRAN and OPTS definitions to refer to the compiler
#  and desired compiler options for your machine.  NOOPT refers to
#  the compiler options desired when NO OPTIMIZATION is selected.
#
#  Note: During a regular execution, LAPACK might create NaN and Inf
#  and handle these quantities appropriately. As a consequence, one
#  should not compile LAPACK with flags such as -ffpe-trap=overflow.

#  Timer for the SECOND and DSECND routines

#TIMER = EXT_ETIME
#  For RS6K:  SECOND and DSECND will use a call to the
#  EXTERNAL FUNCTION ETIME_
#TIMER = EXT_ETIME_
#  For gfortran compiler:  SECOND and DSECND will use a call to the
#  INTERNAL FUNCTION ETIME
#TIMER = INT_ETIME
#  If your Fortran compiler does not provide etime (like Nag Fortran
#  Compiler, etc...) SECOND and DSECND will use a call to the
#  INTERNAL FUNCTION CPU_TIME
TIMER = INT_CPU_TIME
#  If none of these work, you can use the NONE value.
#  In that case, SECOND and DSECND will always return 0.
