RE: UNIX VERSIONS OF BOSOR4, BOSOR5, PANDA2 AVAILABLE

Dear BOSOR4/BOSOR5/PANDA2 users:

The latest versions of BOSOR4, BOSOR5, and PANDA2 are now available for
the following UNIX-based platforms:

SUN Solaris (OS 4.x, 5.5)
Silicon Graphics IRIX
HP9000/700, HP-UX
IBM RS6000
DEC-ALPHA (UNIX v3.2c)


BOSOR4, BOSOR5, and PANDA2 are distributed by:

Professor Charles R. Steele, Department of Applied Mechanics,
Durand Building, Stanford University, Stanford, California, 94305, USA,

Please reply via email to: jeanjleo@leland.stanford.edu   (Mr. Jiunjie Liau)

My main purpose of delivering the codes to Professor Steele at Stanford
University is to aid in supporting further research by students and
professors at the Applied Mechanics Department at Stanford in the areas of
shell analysis and optimization. Many years ago I received a PhD from
Stanford, where I did work in the field of shell buckling.  Having this
special bond with Stanford, I feel that it is appropriate to permit its
Department of Applied Mechanics to distribute my codes, using the proceeds
to support further research in this fascinating and very useful field.

Each programs costs $1000.00. Please identify for what computer and
operating system BOSOR4, BOSOR5, and PANDA2 are wanted.  Please deal
entirely with Stanford Department of Applied Mechanics if you decide you
want these programs. 

Please send me email if you decide to order BOSOR4, BOSOR5, PANDA2, so
that I can send you complete documentation and add your name to my master
list of users.

Sincerely yours,



David Bushnell
