REF: Your request (through xxxxxxxxxx, purchasing) for
     PANDA2/BOSOR4 for the xxxxx workstation.

Dear xxxxx:

The following stuff is a "form" letter I send to any prospective PANDA2
user.

With best regards,
Dave Bushnell

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This message is about the electronic transfer of my computer programs,
BOSOR4 and PANDA2, to your facility. I suggest the following method,
which other customers have found to be convenient and which is best for me.

I can place via "binary" ftp a compressed tar file called 

    panda2.xxxxx.tar.Z 

(in which xxxxx stands for machine type, such as hp700, sgi, rs6k, alpha,...)
on the host computer:

    sbdhost.parl.com ; cd to incoming

and you will be able to "get" it with binary ftp. The compressed
tar file will be about 20 Mbytes long. This file will contain both
the panda2 and the bosor4 programs and their documentation and other
directories/files needed for updating and execution. This method is
a lot better for me. I have always had great difficulty with tapes,
cartridges, etc, especially now that Lockheed, with its extreme
cost-cutting measures, has cut staff so much that we now have nobody
readily available to help with "computer stuff". I am an engineer
(an OLD engineer, I might add), and know very little about UNIX and
other computer science things. I used to run to our computer specialists
to get help with tapes, etc, but these are usually not available nowadays
on short notice.

This is how I place the compressed tar file, panda2.xxxxx.tar.Z, in
the location where you can retrieve it:

  ftp sbdhost.parl.com
  user: anonymous
  pass: bush@trinity.atc.lmco.com  (my email address)
  cd incoming
  binary
  put panda2.xxxxx.tar.Z
  dir panda2.xxxxx.tar.Z  (to check that panda2.xxxxx.tar.Z gets there!)
  bye

You can retrieve panda2.xxxxx.tar.Z by doing the following:

  cd (to directory where you want to store panda2.xxxxx.tar.Z, that is
      the directory that will become the PARENT of the BOSOR4, PANDA2
      directories)
  ftp sbdhost.parl.com
  user: anonymous
  pass: (use your email address)
  cd incoming
  binary
  get panda2.xxxxx.tar.Z

You would let me know as soon as you have successfully transferred
panda2.xxxxx.tar.Z to your facility so that I can remove the file from
sbdhost.parl.com (Anyone can grab it or delete it from there, so I don't
like to leave it there for long. Also, it is a large file and may prevent
others from doing the same thing because of lack of disk space.)

I will do nothing until I receive an email acknowledgment from you.
ftping the rather long (about 20 Mbytes) compressed tar file
panda2.xxxxx.tar.Z is preferable to emailing in my opinion because there
is no splitting involved. I'm not enough of a UNIX person to know how
to email very long files, and as I mentioned above, tapes are troublesome.


Sincerely,
Dave Bushnell

p.s. The following is a partial list of the file ..panda2/doc/howto.update
that will be fully accessable to you after you reconstruct the
PANDA2/BOSOR4 directory structure at your facility. Included here
is what you need to know to set up that directory structure at your facility.
==================================================================

             INFORMATION ABOUT UPDATING PANDA2, BOSOR4, etc.
             ARCHIVING THE UPDATED PANDA2, BOSOR4, etc, PRODUCING
             COMPRESSED "TAR" FILE OF THE ARCHIVE,
             ftp-ing THE "TAR" FILE TO A CUSTOMER,
             RECONSTRUCTING THE PANDA2, BOSOR4, etc, DIRECTORY STRUCTURE,
             AND INITIALIZING IN PREPARATION FOR RUNS.

   (NOTE: This file was originally written with PANDA2 in mind. Therefore
          most of the examples involve PANDA2. However, the same
          instructions apply to BOSOR4, BOSOR5, and other programs by
          Bushnell).
=======================================================================

PART 0:  HOW TO TRANSFER THE COMPRESSED "TAR" FILE TO YOUR FACILITY:

   Often it is a good idea to ftp to
       sbdhost.parl.com ; cd to incoming
   Then a customer can pick up the panda2.xxxxx.tar.Z file from there.
   This way, you avoid having to send a tape, which is a pain.
   This is done as follows:
         rlogin trinity
         cd ~bush/temp
         ftp sbdhost.parl.com
         user: anonymous
         pass: bush@trinity.atc.lmco.com
         cd incoming
         binary
         put panda2.xxxxx.tar.Z
         dir panda2.xxxxx.tar.Z
         bye
   The customer can pick up the file panda2.xxxxx.tar.Z by doing the
   same, except instead of "put" he types "get". He should be at the
   directory which he wants to be the PARENT of BOSOR4, BOSOR5, PANDA2, etc.
   when he "gets" the compressed tar file.


PART 1:  HOW TO UPDATE PANDA2, BOSOR4, etc.:

If you have instructions for updating a source file, here is how you
proceed (example is for PANDA2, but BOSOR4, BOSOR5, etc. are analogous):

(See the file ..doc/howto.update for more details with regard to
 PARTS I - V and PARTs VIII, IX)
========================================================================

PART VI
HOW TO RESTRUCTURE DIRECTORIES AT THE USER'S FACILITY (INSTALL)

1. Go to the directory which you want to be the PARENT of that
   where you want PANDA2, BOSOR4, etc. to reside. If you
   have a tape, copy the file panda2.<machine>.tar.Z from the tape
   to a file with the same name. This is a compressed tar file.
   The argument <machine> of the file name stands for the platform
   (sun4, sgi, dec, hp700, rs6k, etc).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
   How to read tape:
   (a) go to directory where you want the compressed tar file to reside,
       usually, this will be the PARENT of that where you want PANDA2,
       BOSOR4, etc. to reside.
   (b) insert the tape in the tape drive.
   (c) type ONE of the commands listed next:
        tar xf /dev/mt/tps1d5.8500  (tps1d5.8500 is name used at lockheed)
        tar xv                      (used for default drive)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

2. With a *.tar.Z file (that is, a compressed tar file transferred
   via ftp or copied from a tape:
        uncompress *.tar.Z   (for example: uncompress panda2.sgi.tar.Z)
        tar xvf    *.tar     (for example: tar xvf    panda2.sgi.tar)

3. Check to make sure that you have the program "install" and that "install"
   is executable.  If it is not, then give the command "chmod 700 install"

4. Execute "install":     install
   and follow the directions that appear at the end of the output
   NOTE: There are some systems that use the word "install" for special
   purposes. You may have to give the command (..path to PANDA2's version
   of install)/install
========================================================================

PART VII
HOW TO RUN

1. All users of BOSOR4, BOSOR5, PANDA2, GENOPT, etc. must run the shell
program called "initialize", which is located in the bin/ directory,
before running any of the programs. They must run "initialize" by 
"source-ing" the file so that the environment variables "initialize"
initializes exist in the user's top-level environment:

        source (..path to bin/...)/bin/initialize

Do "pwd" to find the path to bin/.

NOTE: There are two /bin directories, one in the parent directory to
/panda2 and one in the /panda2 directory. The "bin" that is wanted here
is the one in the parent directory to /panda2.

ANOTHER NOTE: If customer users are on ksh (korn shell) rather than
csh (C shell), then before "source" you must type

       /bin/csh
