This file is called: "build_archive.session"

INTRODUCTION:

This is an example of a "build_archive" interactive session.
The purpose of "build_archive" is to create a proper directory
structure containing one or more of David Bushnell's computer
programs. The reason for creating such a directory structure
is that you may want to transfer one or more of David Bushnell's
computer programs to another site. In order to do this, you
must create a "tar" file that contains the proper directory
structure that you want to port to the other site. Hence,
there are two steps in this process:

Step 1, execute "build_archive": /home/progs/bin/build_archive
Step 2, create the "tar" file:   tar cvfl <name-of-file>.tar *

NOTE: in the following list the "home" directory is called
"/home/progs". This is the now empty directory which will become
the PARENT directory of David Bushnell's computer programs
that will next be archived via the "build_archive" script. At
your present site from which you are planning to execute "build_archive:,
replace the string, "/home/progs", with whatever string applies
at your facility.

First, create or go to a directory with nothing in it or
create a directory with nothing in it.

cd (to an empty directory)

or

mkdir <name-of-empty-directory>

cd <name-of-empty-directory>

Then perform the two steps:
Step 1, execute "build_archive": /home/progs/bin/build_archive
Step 2, create the "tar" file  :  tar cvfl <name-of-file>.tar *
end of INTRODUCTION
--------------------------------------------------------------

STEP 1, execute "build_archive" (an image of the session follows):
--------------------------------------------------------------------
bush-> /home/progs/bin/build_archive
Please enter the name of the parent directory of D. Bushnell's programs.
Enter return if directory is /home/bush
Enter directory: /home/progs

build_archive takes all of David Bushnell's programs (BOSOR4, BOSOR5,
PANDA, etc.) and creates a temporary directory structure as it should
appear for distribution to the general public on a LINUX file system.
The following items are distributed:

       1)  All of the latest sources files
       2)  All necessary shell programs for normal program operation
       3)  All documentation
       4)  Sample cases
       5)  Makefiles and Executables for SUN-3, SUN-4, and/or DECstation
           3100/5000 environments as requested.
       6)  Library and Object file directories for each of the three
           computing environments.  These directories are empty when
           installed, but they are needed by the makefile when
           re-making the program.

   In addition to D. Bushnell's programs, three general-purpose public
  domain utility programs are included.  These utilities are used by
  Bushnell's programs.

       1)  xgraph - an x-y plotting program for X-windows
       2)  plotps - an x-y plotting program that produces PostScript
                    output.  Uses same syntax as xgraph.
       3)  gawk   - a full-featured version of the more commonly known
                    awk text-processing interpreter.

  The source files for these utilities are included in their own
  directories, but the executable versions are placed in the ~/bin
  directory.

  Last, but not least, an install script is included at the top level.
  This program is to be run by the client on his/her own machine after
  D. Bushnell's programs have been successfully de-archived.

  A word of caution:  You must have at least 700 Mbytes of free disk space
  available in your working directory in order to archive all of the
  programs in one sitting.

Please enter a list of programs you wish to archive.  If you do not wish
to archive one or more of the programs, just press return.  In this case,
all of the utilities will be archived, but none of the programs.
Enter from the list below.

        bosor4, bigbosor4, bosor5, panda, panda2, & genopt

Enter program list: bosor4 bigbosor4 bosor5 panda2 genopt

Please enter a list of machines you wish your archive to support.  If
you do not wish to support any machines (i.e. you do not want to archive
executables), just press return.  PLEASE NOTE THAT NOT ALL PROGRAMS ARE
SUPPORTED ON ALL MACHINES. Only the LINUX version is now supported.

Enter from the list below.

  sun3 - for SUN-3 workstation
  sun4 - for SUN SPARCstation running Sun OS 4.x
   sol - for SUN SPARCstation running Sun OS 5.x (a.k.a. Solaris)
   dec - for DECstation 3100 or 5000
 alpha - for DEC Alpha workstation
 linux - for LINUX operating systems.
  cray - for CRAY ?MP mainframe
   sgi - for Silicon Graphics IRIS workstations
  sgi8 - for Silicon Graphics IRIX 6.5 workstations
 hp700 - for HP 9000/700 workstation
  rs6k - for IBM RS-6000 workstation

You have now finished creating an image of the actual archive as it will
appear on the client's machine.  Now copy the directories you have
created to tape or to a file as appropriate using tar or a suitable
archive utility.

If you are creating a file archive for ftp-ing or for writing a disc,
give the following command:

       tar cvfl {choose_a_name}.tar *

In order to install and execute at your facility, do the following:

 1. unpack the tar 
    tar xvf {name_you_chose}.tar

 2. execute install from the parent directory:
    <path-to-parent-directory> install

 3. source <path-to-parent-directory>/bin/initialize

You can put the tar file, b4bigb4b5p2g.linux.tar, on a CD to
 mail to someone or to port to another LINUX machine.

In this particular "build_archive" interactive session, we
chose to include all D. Bushnell's computer programs except PANDA,
which has been superseded by PANDA2. In your "build_archive"
session you can choose whichever computer programs you want.
However, please note the following:

 1. If you choose GENOPT you should also choose BIGBOSOR4 because
    GENOPT has built into it the capability to optimize shells
    of revolution using BIGBOSOR4 software.

 2  If you choose PANDA2 you must also choose BOSOR4 because
    PANDA2 uses BOSOR4 software.
