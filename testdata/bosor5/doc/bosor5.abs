                BOSOR5  ABSTRACT

BOSOR5 performs axisymmetric collapse and nonsymmetric bifurcation
buckling including elastic-plastic material and creep. Does not
supercede BOSOR4 because BOSOR5 has no modal vibration or linear
nonsymmetric stress analysis capabilities. Segmented or branched
multi-material, layered shells. Smeared stringers permitted to go
plastic. Static analysis only.  Self-correcting strategy for solution
of the nonlinear prebuckling problem provides reasonably accurate
answers independent of the size of the load or time step. Welding
distortions and residual stresses can be generated by application
of thermal cycles. Discrete rings of arbitrary cross section can go
plastic. Input is interactive with considerable on line "HELP", as
with BOSOR4. Plotting as with BOSOR4. Considerable exercise by
many users over many years has shaken out bugs. Program runs fast.
Developer maintains BOSOR5.
