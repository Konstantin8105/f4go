The PostScript file, metafile.ps, has been created.
Please choose one of the three options below:

   1) Rename the PostScript file this is useful if
      you don't have access to a PostScript printer on your
      machine, but you wish to save to a file so you can later
      transfer it to a different machine for printing.

         Example:  mv metafile.ps plot1.ps

   2) Enter an "lpr" command.  This is useful if your default
      printer is not PostScript, but there is a PostScript
      printer available on your system.

         Example:  lpr -PApplelaser metafile.ps

   3) Press the return key.  This executes the command:

                   lpr metafile.ps

      This assumes that your default printer is a PostScript
      printer.

Enter your command> <carriage return>
