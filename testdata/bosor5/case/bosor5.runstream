BOSOR5 RUN STREAM, STARTING FROM SCRATCH

The purpose of this run stream is to generate the
valid input file for BOSOR5 called "1.ALL". The
BOSOR5 sample case, 1.ALL, is analogous to the
BIGBOSOR4 sample case also called 1.ALL. Note,
however, that the input data for BOSOR5 are
somewhat different from the input data for BIGBOSOR4.

The valid input file, 1.ALL, is generated mostly by
use of the command, INPUT, by means of which an
interactive session is launched in which the user
generates a number of files, *.SEG1, *.SEG2, ...
in which "*" denotes the user-selected name for
the case, which in this case is "1".


First, go to a working directory where you want to
run BOSOR5. Then do the following:

bush-> bosor5log

BOSOR5 commands have been activated.
Below are the BOSOR5 commands, listed in the order in which you
would probably use them.

input - interactive input of data for each segment
assemble - concatenates the segment data files
bosorread - runs BOSOR5 pre-processor
mainsetup - interactive input of data for main processor
bosormain - runs BOSOR5 main processor
postsetup - interactive input of data for post processor
bosorpost - runs BOSOR5 post processor
bosorplot - generates plot files from most previous run
cleanup - delete all case files except for .DOC file
getsegs - generate segment files from .DOC file
modify - interactively modify a segment or global data file

Please consult the following sources for more information about BOSOR5:
1. .../bosor5/doc/bosor5st.ory (good idea to print this file)
2. Documents listed under HELP5 OVERVIEW DOC

 BOSOR5 INPUT DATA, INTERACTIVE MODE

 Initial prompts are short, and contain data names a new user
 will not be familiar with.  Please type HELP or H instead of
 any datum called for, and you will get more information on that
 datum.

 Page numbers contained in some of the prompts refer to the
 original BOSOR5 user's manual, "BOSOR5--a computer program
 for buckling of elastic-plastic complex shells of revolution
 including large deflections and creep", Lockheed Missiles &
 Space Co. Report LMSC-D407166, December 1974, Vol. 1: User's
 manual, input data.  This user's manual contains additional
 discussion and figures.

 NOTE:  This version of BOSOR5 will handle up to 200 shell
        segments, rather than the 25 stated as a limit in the
        user's manual.



 Please provide a title (42 characters or less)...

         0
 Do you want general information on loading?=y
 y

 The following input is related to loading of this
 segment.  All loads are considered to be axisymmetric
 and to be products of spatial times temporal functions.
 For example, the pressure, p(s,time), is given by:
   p(s,time) = Po(s) * f(time)
 in which s is the meridional arc length.  In this section
 you will be asked to provide only the spatial variation
 of the loads [e.g. Po(s) ] and pointers to the temporal
 variations, not the temporal variations  f(t) themselves.
 The f(t) to which the pointers point will be asked for
 after data for all the shell segments have been provided
 by you.  (See pp. P30-P31 for discussion and illustrations.)

 There are three types of loading:
 1. temperature
 2. normal pressure and meridional traction, and
 3. line loads and/or imposed displacement components
    applied at centroids of discrete rings.

 Temperature rise (+) above or fall (-) below that
 corresponding to the zero stress state. You will be
 asked to provide distributions along the meridian
 and through the thickness. (See pp. P32-P39)

 NTSTAT = number of temperature callout points along meridian=h

 NTSTAT = 0 means no temperature distrib. to be specified;
 NTSTAT = 1 means temperature is uniform along meridian;
 NTSTAT > 1 means temperature is nonuniform along meridian.

 If NTSTAT > 1 you will be asked to provide callout points
 (See illustrations on p. P33 and p. P35).  BOSOR5 will
 automatically linearly interpolate between callout points.
 Make sure to include end points of the shell segment in
 determining NTSTAT.

 NTSTAT = number of temperature callout points along meridian=0
         0

 Next, provide input for normal pressure and meridional
 traction...

 NPSTAT = number of meridional callouts for pressure=h

 NPSTAT = 0 means no pressure or meridional traction;
 NPSTAT = 1 means uniform distributed loading;
 NPSTAT > 1 means meridionally nonuniform loading.

 In determining NPSTAT, please include the endpoints
 of the shell segment.  BOSOR5 linearly interpolates
 the pressure and meridional traction between callout
 points that you will provide along the meridian.
 See the illustration at the top of p. P45.

 NPSTAT = number of meridional callouts for pressure=2
         2

 Next provide meridional callout points for pressure...

 NTYPE = control for meaning of loading callout (2=z, 3=r)=2
         2
 Z(I)  = axial coordinate of Ith loading callout, z( 1)=0.
   0.000000
 Z(I)  = axial coordinate of Ith loading callout, z( 2)=0.453
  0.4530000

 Next provide normal pressure and meridional traction
 at the meridional callouts...

 PN(J)= normal pressure at meridional callout pt. no.( 1)=h

 PN is positive as shown in the top figure on p. P45.
 Pressure between callouts is calculated by BOSOR5 by
 linear interpolation.  The actual pressure is a product

    P = PN * f(time)

 in which the function of time f(time) remains to be
 specified.

 PN(J)= normal pressure at meridional callout pt. no.( 1)=-1.
  -1.000000
 PN(J)= normal pressure at meridional callout pt. no.( 2)=-1.
  -1.000000
 PT(J)= meridional traction at callout point no.( 1)=0
         0
 PT(J)= meridional traction at callout point no.( 2)=0
         0
 ISTEP = control integer for time variation of pressure=h

 Note that the same time function is to be associated
 with both the normal pressure and the meridional
 traction.

 The control integer, ISTEP, is a pointer which will
 cause the appropriate function of time to be associated
 with the spatial pressure distribution that you have
 just provided.  Different functions of time can be
 associated with the pressure distributions in
 different shell segments.  The exact nature of these
 time functions will be asked of you later.  Right now
 all you need do is to specify 1 or 2 or 3, or other
 simple integer.  Start with an appropriate value which
 depends on what other loads you have already specified
 in this case up to now.  ISTEP should be unity if this
 is the first load ever specified in this case.

 Each time a new time function is to be introduced, use
 a higher integer (higher by 1) than has ever been used
 before to specify the time variation of any load, whether
 it be for a previously specified temperature distribution,
 pressure or surface traction distribution, or line load.
 This word 'previous' includes loads that you have
 specified in previous segments as well as those specified
 previously in the current segment.

 ISTEP = control integer for time variation of pressure=1
         1
 Do you want to print out distributed loads along meridian?=n
 n

 LINTYP=control for line loads or disp.(0=none,1=some)=h

 Line loads must always be associated with a discrete ring,
 and they are assumed to act at the discrete ring centroid,
 as shown in the Fig. at the bottom of p. P47.  Note that
 hydrostatic pressure gives rise to line loads, pr/2, at
 the ends of the shell structure, thus requiring you to use
 LINTYP = 1 for those segments in which pr/2 acts.

 Imposed axisymmetric displacement components (USTAR, WSTAR,
 CHI, see page P66, left-hand top for positive values) must
 always be associated with a discrete ring. In the following
 input for loading:
       V(K) can mean axial load or axial displacement
            (note: positive V (load) [p. P47] is in opposite
                   direction from positive V (displacement)
                   [USTAR on p. P66]  )
      HF(K) can mean radial load or radial displacement
      FM(K) can mean meridional moment or meridional rotation

 LINTYP=control for line loads or disp.(0=none,1=some)=0
         0

 each be associated with a new material index number.

 n

 Next, provide data which pertain to the entire structure,
 such as time variation of loads, boundary conditions, and
 junction conditions...

 Do you want information on time functions for loading?=y
 y
 Data for time variation of loads is next.  In common
 cases (no creep, all loads varying proportionally and
 generally increasing until bifurcation buckling or
 collapse occurs) it is advisable to identify "time"
 directly with "load" and time increment with load
 increment.  Hence, whenever possible, the loading
 functions of time should be set equal to the time:

          f(time) = time

 In this way you will be able to read the load directly
 from the output; "TIME" will be the same as "load".
 Please refer to pp. P30-P31 for examples.

 IUTIME = control for time increment (0 or 1). IUTIME=h

 0 means time increment varies during case
 1 means time increment is constant during case.

 Please see the examples on pp. P30-P31 and pp. P61-P63.
 For most cases (except perhaps those involving creep) you
 will want to set IUTIME = 1.

 IUTIME = control for time increment (0 or 1). IUTIME=1
         1
 DTIME = time increment=h

 See the discussion on pp. P30-P31.  If you have a situation
 in which all loads are being increased in proportion, then
 it is best to set the time increment equal to the increment
 of what you feel to be the most important load component of
 the case. (e.g. external pressure increment).  For example,
 if you think a shell will collapse at about 100 psi, then
 you might wish to reach 100 psi in 10-psi increments. The
 time increment, DTIME, you would then set equal to 10.  For
 most cases, DTIME doesn't signify a real time increment; TIME
 in BOSOR5 is just a convenient parameter to use for provision
 of applied loads that vary nonproportionally during a case. In
 cases involving creep, TIME is real time, of course.

 DTIME = time increment=1.0
   1.000000
 TMAX = maximum time to be encountered during this case=h

 As with DTIME, you associate TMAX with the most important
 load component and set it equal to the largest value of that
 load component that could possibly be of any interest at
 all.  Overestimate here.  For example, if you think the
 shell you are studying might collapse at 100 psi, use TMAX
 of about 10000 or 100000.

 TMAX = maximum time to be encountered during this case=100000.
   100000.0

 Next, specify the various time functions associated with
 the loads on the structure. These are the fi(time) to which
 the pointers, ISTEP, IDTEMP, etc. point.

 NFTIME= number of different functions of time=h

 For example, you may have a case involving a temperature
 distribution which is constant with time and a pressure
 distribution which varies linearly with time.  In such a
 case, NFTIME = 2, since there are two functions of time,
 one function (the temperature) a constant and the other
 (the pressure) a varying quantity (See example, p. P30).

 NFTIME must be equal to the highest value of any of the
 pointers, IDTEMP, ISTEP, ISTEP1, ISTEP2, ISTEP3, which
 were specified in the sections on temperature and
 loading input. (See page P38 for IDTEMP, p. P44 for ISTEP,
 p. P46 for ISTEP1, ISTEP2, ISTEP3.)

 NFTIME= number of different functions of time=1
         1

 Next, please provide the time variations of loading which
 correspond to the pointers IDTEMP, ISTEP, etc. that you
 have already given. Each time-varying load factor is to be
 provided by you in the form of a vector of time callouts,
 T(i,j), j=1,NPOINT, followed by a vector of corresponding
 load factors F(i,j), j=1,NPOINT, where i = 1, 2, 3...NFTIME.
 The index j is in the inner loop.

 NPOINT=no. of points j for ith load factor F(i,j). i=( 1)=h

 NPOINT must be greater than or equal to 2 and less than
 or equal to 50.  For constant or linearly varying loads
 NPOINT should be 2.  See p. P63 for an example. In
 common cases, the time increase is identified directly
 with the load increase: time = load, essentially. In
 such a case, NPOINT = 2.

 NPOINT=no. of points j for ith load factor F(i,j). i=( 1)=2
         2

 T(i,j)=jth time callout for ith time function, j =( 1)=h

 T(i,j) must be less than or equal to TMAX.

 T(i,j)=jth time callout for ith time function, j =( 1)=0.
   0.000000
 T(i,j)=jth time callout for ith time function, j =( 2)=10000.
   10000.00

 Next, provide the vector of load factors F(i,j). i=

 F(i,j)=jth value for ith load factor. j =( 1)=h

 For common cases (no creep) it is advisable to identify
 the load factor F(i,j) with time T(i,j).  Thus,

      F(i,j) = T(i,j) ; in other words, f(time) = time

 Then in the output when "time" is printed, you will know
 directly what the load is.

 F(i,j)=jth value for ith load factor. j =( 1)=0.
   0.000000
 F(i,j)=jth value for ith load factor. j =( 2)=10000.
   10000.00
 How many segments are there in the structure?=3

 Four kinds of constraint conditions exist in BOSOR5:

  1. constraints to ground (e.g. boundary conditions)
  2. juncture compatibility conditions
  3. regularity conditions at poles (where radius r = 0)
  4. constraints to prevent rigid body displacements

 See the figs. on p. P67, for example. There is a constraint
 to ground (boundary condition) at Seg. 8, Point 8; there are
 several juncture conditions (e.g. Seg. 2, Pt. 1 is connected
 to Seg. 1, Pt. 9); there are several poles (e.g. Seg. 1,
 Pt. 1).  Note that if a shell is not anywhere attached to
 ground, such as is the case for the example shown on p. P75,
 you must choose a node at which to prevent rigid body
 motion.  You must choose this node in the section below where
 you are asked about constraints to ground. In a section
 following the "constraints-to-ground" section, you will
 be asked to provide specific data for preventing rigid body
 motion.  Types of rigid body motion are shown on p. P73. An
 example of appropriate input data is listed on p. P75, bottom.

 It may be necessary to provide additional constraint to
 ground in order to prevent rigid body motion in the
 bifurcation buckling phase of the analysis.  All possible
 types of rigid body motion are shown on p. P73. Rigid body
 motion corresponds to n = 0 or n = 1 circumferential waves.
 There is no rigid body component for any harmonic with n
 greater than or equal to 2.  Note that the following question
 applies only to the bifurcation buckling phase of the
 analysis, not to the axisymmetric prebuckling phase.

 Given existing constraints, are rigid body modes possible?=n

 INDIC = analysis type indicator (0 or -2 or -3). INDIC=h

  0= nonlinear axisymmetric stress (and collapse) analysis;
 -2= axisymmetric prebuckling states and stability determinant
     are calculated for several load  (time) steps. (See p. M3)
 -3= stability determinant is calculated for a case in which
     prebuckling states have been obtained in a previous run.
     See p. M5.

 INDIC = analysis type indicator (0 or -2 or -3). INDIC=-2
        -2
 Type HELP or H for more information on INDIC, N for "no more"=h

 INDIC=0 means that nonlinear axisymmetric stress analysis
 will be performed for a sequence of time (load) steps
 specified by you either in the BOSOR5 preprocessor or in
 the following. The results for every time step are saved so
 that the case can be restarted at any time step. It is also
 possible to restart with a different value of INDIC.

 INDIC = -2 means that a nonlinear axisymmetric stress
 analysis will be performed and that the stability determinant
 will be calculated for several time steps for a certain
 fixed number, N0B, of circumferential waves. If the stability
 determinant for N0B waves changes sign in the user-specified
 time range, then bifurcation buckling loads are calculated
 for a range of circumferential wave numbers, NMINB through
 NMAXB in increments of INCRB, with NMINB, NMAXB, INCRB to be
 provided by you.  See the figure at the bottom of p. M3.
 (Type H for more help, N for no more.)

 Type HELP or H for more information on INDIC, N for "no more"=h
 INDIC = -2 (continued)  If the stability determinant does
 not change sign eigenvalues for the range NMINB to NMAXB are
 still computed.  In either case (whether or not the
 stability determinant changes sign) you should pursue the
 buckling analysis in a restart for a new circumferential
 wavenumber: that wavenumber corresponding to the minimum
 eigenvalue, as shown in Fig (3) at the bottom of p. M3.

 INDIC = - 3 means that the stability determinant for a given
 number, N0B, of circumferential waves will be calculated for
 a sequence of time steps for which the prebuckling analysis
 was done in a previous run with INDIC = 0 or INDIC = -2.
 Bifurcation buckling loads are calculated for a user-
 provided range, NMINB to NMAXB, of circumferential wavenumbers
 as described above.
 (Type H for more information on INDIC, N for no more.)

 Type HELP or H for more information on INDIC, N for "no more"=h
 Note...In problems involving bifurcation buckling in the
 plastic range of material behavior, the actual values of
 the eigenvalues obtained by BOSOR5 are not too meaningful.
 The sign of the eigenvalues and their relationship to
 eachother (that is, for which circumferential wave number
 is there a minimum eigenvalue) are important, however.
 Briefly, the eigenvalue analysis in BOSOR5 has two purposes:

   1. to help the search for a minimum buckling load
      with respect to the number of circumferential waves;

   2. to yield buckling mode shapes, which guide the
      engineer toward a better design.

 IDEFORM=indicator (0 or 1) for type of plasticity theory=h

 IDEFORM = 0 means that flow theory will be used to
             calculate the constitutive law for both
             the prebuckling and the bifurcation buckling
             analyses;

 IDEFORM = 1 means that flow theory will be used in the
             prebuckling analysis and deformation theory
             in the bifurcation buckling analysis.

 NOTE...In order to run INDIC = -3 with deformation theory you
        must have previously run INDIC = -2 with IDEFORM = 1.

 IDEFORM=indicator (0 or 1) for type of plasticity theory=0
         0
 ICPRE = control (0 or 1) for type of eigenvalue problem=h

 In cases for which all loads (and temperatures) vary
 with pseudo-time in the same proportion, use ICPRE = 1.
 Otherwise, use ICPRE = 0. For more details see the
 discussion on the right-hand side of p. 407 of the paper
 by Lagae and Bushnell, "Elastic-plastic buckling of
 torispherical vessel heads", Nuclear Engineering and Design,
 Vol. 48 (1978) pp 405-414

 Do you want to reverse the rate of loading?=h

 For example, you may wish to unload from the latest
 converged step or from some earlier step.

 n
 KSTEP = starting time step number=h

 If this is the first run (not a restart) KSTEP must be 0.
 If this is a restart, then KSTEP must be equal to a value
 for which prebuckling results have already been obtained
 in a previous run. (After the first run, KSTEP = 1
 corresponds to the first time step.

 KSTEP = starting time step number=0
         0
 KMAX = maximum (less than 49) time step number=h

 As a rule of thumb, do less than 10 time steps per run.
 Look at your results after each run and make use of the
 restart capability.

 KMAX = maximum (less than 49) time step number=2
         2
 MAXTRL =  maximum number of trials at each load level=h

 The figure on p. M7 explains what is meant by a "trial".  In
 BOSOR5 several trials for a converged solution are attempted
 at each time step (level of loading). The purpose of each
 trial is to obtain updated material properties. Use between
 3 and 10, usually closer to 3 for best results.

 MAXTRL =  maximum number of trials at each load level=5
         5
 ITMAX = maximum number of Newton iterations for each trial=h

 ITMAX between 4 and 10 is recommended. 6 is a good number.

 ITMAX = maximum number of Newton iterations for each trial=6
         6
 ITIME = control (0 or 1) for time increments=h

 ITIME = 0 means use time increment(s) specified in
           the preprocessor;
 ITIME = 1 means use a new time increment

 ITIME = control (0 or 1) for time increments=0
         0
 Do you wish to force the material to remain elastic?=h

 Usual answer is N.  If you are having numerical difficulty
 you may want to answer Y.

 N0B   = starting number of circ. waves (buckling analysis)=h

 circumferential wavenumber.  See pp. M12 and M13 for
 estimates.

         6
 NMINB = minimum number of circ. waves  (buckling analysis)=5

3. In specifying the range of circumferential numbers to be covered
in the bifurcation buckling analysis, we deliberately excluded values
near N = 2 crcumferential waves. Therefore, we are capturing only one
of the 2 minima contained in the "complete" range of N just listed
from the BIGBOSOR4 runstream.

Next, we wish to run the BOSOR5 post-processors, POSTSETUP and
BOSORPOST. First, we conduct the interactive session, POSTSETUP.

 Interactive input for BOSOR5 postprocessor...

 IPRINT = control (1 or 2 or 3) for list output=h

 IPRINT = 1 means prebuckling states listed for selected
            time steps;
 IPRINT = 2 means buckling modes printed for selected
            circumferential wave numbers;
 IPRINT = 3 means both prebuckling states and buckling modes
            printed for selected time steps and selected
            circumferential wave numbers.

 IPRINT = control (1 or 2 or 3) for list output=2
         2
 IPLOT  = control (0 or 1 or 2 or 3) for plot output=h

 IPLOT  = 0 means no plots at all;
 IPLOT  = 1 means prebuckling states plotted for selected
            time steps;
 IPLOT  = 2 means buckling modes plotted for selected
            circumferential wave numbers;
 IPLOT  = 3 means prebuckling states and buckling modes
            plotted for selected time steps and selected
            circumferential wave numbers.

         2
 NLAST = plot options  (-1=none, 0=geometry, 1=u,v,w)=h

 NLAST = -1 means no plotting;
          0 means plots of undeformed and deformed
            geometry only;
          1 means plots of geometry and u,v,w vs arc length.

 NLAST = plot options  (-1=none, 0=geometry, 1=u,v,w)=0
         0
 Do you want to plot the discretized model?=y
 y

 Your structure may contain segments that are very short
 compared to the whole model being analyzed here. This detail
 will not show up well in plots of the entire undeformed and
 deformed structure. Therefore you may wish to get expanded
 plots of these regions. Please identify these regions by
 segment number and give a magnification factor for each region.
 Note that the magnification factor must be an integer.
 The center of the expanded plot will be at the first point of
 the segment so identified. The extent of structure plotted
 will of course depend on the magnification factor you choose.

 Are there any regions for which you want expanded plots?=n
 n

 Selection of buckling modes follows...

 NMODES=quantity of buckling modes to be listed, plotted=h

 One mode/circumferential wave number. You rarely need to
 see all of the modes calculated by the main processor; the
 critical mode is the most important, of course.

 NMODES=quantity of buckling modes to be listed, plotted=1
         1
 NTHMOD(i)=ith mode calculated in last main run. i=( 1)=h

 Use the order in which the modes were calculated in the
 last run of the BOSOR5 main processor as a guide here,
 not the number of circumferential waves.  For example, if
 modes for circ. waves n = 5, 10, 15, 20 were calculated in
 that order, and you want to list and/or plot the modes
 corresponding to n = 5 and n = 15, then set NTHMOD(1) = 1
 (first mode calculated) and NTHMOD(2) = 3 (third mode
 calculated).

 NTHMOD(i)=ith mode calculated in last main run. i=( 1)=6
         6
 NWAVE(i)=no. of circ. waves in the ith mode. i=( 1)=h

 In the above example NWAVE(1) = 5 and NWAVE(2) = 15.

 NWAVE(i)=no. of circ. waves in the ith mode. i=( 1)=10
        10 
 Do you want buckling modal output for all the segments?=y
 y

 Next, give the command BOSORPOST

The PostScript file, metafile.ps, has been created.
Please choose one of the three options below:

   1) Rename the PostScript file this is useful if
      you don't have access to a PostScript printer on your
      machine, but you wish to save to a file so you can later
      transfer it to a different machine for printing.

         Example:  mv metafile.ps plot1.ps

   2) Enter an "lpr" command.  This is useful if your default
      printer is not PostScript, but there is a PostScript
      printer available on your system.

         Example:  lpr -PApplelaser metafile.ps

   3) Press the return key.  This executes the command:

                   lpr metafile.ps

      This assumes that your default printer is a PostScript
      printer.

Enter your command> <enter>
Printing PostScript plot on the default printer...
