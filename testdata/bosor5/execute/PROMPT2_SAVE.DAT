80.1  Have any data already been provided by you for this case?
85.1  Have the data for all of the segments been provided by you?
90.1  What segment number is this? (provide in increasing order)
95.1  Have the data for boundary conditions been provided by you?
100.0 
      The following input must be provided by you for each
      shell segment.  See p. P1 for a list of the types of
      input data required.

      NOTE: Up to 200 segments are now permitted in BOSOR5.

101.1 NMESH=no. of node points (5=min.;98=max.) 
101.2  
      See p. 1.3, P3, and P4 for additional information on the
      number and on the distribution of nodal points.
      Note that the maximum number of degrees of freedom for
      the entire structure is limited to 2000 for the axisymmetric
      nonlinear analysis, in which only u and w are present as
      unknowns, and 3000 for buckling, vibration, or linear
      nonsymmetric stress analysis, in which u, v, and w are
      present as unknowns.  Formulas for the number of d.o.f.
      are as follows...

      For the axisymmetric analysis the total d. o. f. are:

      d.o.f.= SUM[(NMESH(ISEG)+2)*2] +3*NSEG + 3*NCOND

      in which the SUM is taken over the number of segments NSEG
      and NCOND is the number of points along the meridian at
      which constraint or junction conditions are imposed.  For
      the nonaxisymmetric bifurcation buckling analysis the
      number of degrees of freedom is:

      d.o.f.= SUM[(NMESH(ISEG)+2)*3] +4*NSEG + 4*NCOND

      
102.1 NTYPEH= control integer (1 or 2 or 3) for nodal point spacing
102.2 
       NTYPEH = 1 or 2 means variable spacing (use 1 rather than 2);
       NTYPEH = 3 means constant spacing.
      EXAMPLE....
      Suppose you have a segment with NMESH = 50, and you wish
      to concentrate nodal points at the beginning of the segment.
      The following input data could be used...
      ================================================================
        DATUM    NAME OF DATUM          MEANING
      ----------------------------------------------------------------
        50          NMESH       number of nodes in segment
         1          NTYPEH      NTYPEH = 1 means variable spacing
         4          NHVALU      number of callouts along the meridian 
         1          IHVALU(1)   nodal point number, first callout
        20          IHVALU(2)   nodal point number, second callout
        21          IHVALU(3)   nodal point number, third callout
        49          IHVALU(4)   nodal point number, fourth callout
       0.1          HVALU(1)    spacing between 1st and 2nd nodes
       0.1          HVALU(2)    spacing between 20th and 21st nodes
       1.0          HVALU(3)    spacing between 21st and 22nd nodes
       1.0          HVALU(4)    spacing between 49th and 50th nodes
      ===============================================================
102.3   
      In the above example IHVALU(i) are the nodal point callouts
      for nodal point spacing and HVALU(i) are the spacings between
      the callout and the next node.  Absolute values of the
      spacings are not required; only relative values are needed,
      such round numbers as 0.1, 1.0, or 0.2.  In BOSOR5 it is best
      to keep the spacing constant over many nodes and then change
      it abruptly, as is done in the above example, rather than to
      vary the spacing gradually over many nodes.

103.1 NHVALU= number of callouts for nodal point spacing
103.2 
      Minimum value of NHVALU is 2; maximum value is 50.
      You must include the first node as a callout point and
      the second-to-last node as a callout point.
      See p. P5 for an example with variable spacing.

104.1 IHVALU(I)= Ith callout for nodal point spacing, IHVALU
104.2  
      IHVALU(1) must be 1 and IHVALU(NHVALU) must be NMESH-1.
      Spacing will vary linearly between the callouts you provide.

105.1 HVALU=meridional arc length between nodal points,HVALU
105.2
      This is the arc length between the nodal point corres-
      ponding to the callout and the next nodal point.
      Absolute values are not required; only relative values
      are needed, such round numbers as 1.0, 0.5, and the like.
      BOSOR4 will automatically expand or contract the total
      arc length to match that generated in the geometry
      routines later.

110.0 
      Geometry of the current segment...

111.1 NSHAPE= indicator (1,2 or 4) for geometry of meridian
111.2  
      See pp. P7 and P9 for illustrations...

      NSHAPE = 2 means spherical, toroidal, or ogival
                 (constant meridional curvature)
      NSHAPE = 3 not used
      NSHAPE = 4 means ellipsoidal or general shape (use with 
                 caution. If possible build up a complex shape
                 with use of NSHAPE = 1 and NSHAPE = 2 segments.

122.1 SROT=indicator for direction of increasing arc (-1. or +1.)
122.2

      -1 means anticlockwise;  +1 means clockwise.

123.1 NST   = indicator for geometry: 1=general, 4=ellipsoid
124.1 NZRIN = number of input coordinates (use 50 or less)
125.1 Z(I)=axial coordinate, Z of Ith input coordinate, Z
126.1 R(I)  =radial coordinate of Ith input coordinate, R
127.1 ZMAX  = length of half of axial axis of ellipsoid (p.P9)
128.1 XMAX  = length of half of radial axis of ellipsoid
129.1 ZA    = axial distance to beginning of segment (p.P9)
130.1 ZB    = axial distance to end of segment (p. P9)
131.1 ALPHAT= radial distance from axis of rev. to center.
131.2  
      See Figures on p. P9 for illustration of input.
      Note that ZA must be less than ZB.
      Note that if an ellipsoidal dome is at the top of the
      structure rather than at the bottom, as is shown in the
      lower right-hand of the three figures on
      page P9, that ZA and ZB are greater than ZMAX (ZB would
      be 2.*ZMAX, for example, if the dome were closed at the
      top.)

132.0 
      Imperfection geometry....

133.1 IMP   = indicator for imperfection (0=none, 1=some)
134.1 ITYPE = indicator (1 or 2 or 3) for type of imperfection
134.2  
      ITYPE = 1 means sinusoidal series with random amplitudes
                and wavelengths;
      ITYPE = 2 means pure sinusoidal.
      ITYPE = 3 means sum of pure sinusoidal (deterministic
                amplitudes and wavelengths of harmonics).

135.1 FM    = number of wavelengths to be included
136.1 C     = maximum amplitude of the imperfection
137.1 FLMIN = minimum half-wavelength of the imperfection
138.1 FLMAX = maximum half-wavelength of the imperfection
139.1 W0    = amplitude of pure sinusoidal imperfection
140.1 WLNGTH= half-wavelength of pure sinusoidal imperfection
140.2  
      See p. P10 for more explanation. Note that imperfections
      should be of the order of the thickness or less.

141.1 NTYPEZ= control (1 or 3) for reference surface location
141.2  
      NTYPEZ = 1 means that the distance from the shell wall
      leftmost surface to the reference surface varies along
      the meridian.  By "leftmost" we mean as we face in the
      direction of increasing meridional arc length, s.  See
      the figure (a) on p. P13.
         
      NTYPEZ = 3 means that the distance from  the  leftmost
      surface of the wall to the reference surface is const-
      ant as we proceed along the meridian, s.

142.1 NZVALU= number of meridional callouts for ref. surf.
142.2  
      Range of NZVALU is 2 to 50.  You must include the beginning
      and the end of the meridian.
      EXAMPLE....
      The following example could correspond to the figure
      on page P13, left bottom:
      ==========================================================
        DATUM       NAME OF DATUM          MEANING
      ----------------------------------------------------------
          4             NZVALU     number of callouts
          2             NTYPE     callouts are axial coords.
        1.0             Z(1)      axial location of 1st callout
        1.5             Z(2)      axial location of 2nd callout
        1.8             Z(3)      axial location of 3rd callout
        3.0             Z(4)      axial location of 4th callout
        0.5             ZVAL(1)   ref. surf. loc. at 1st callout
        0.5             ZVAL(2)   ref. surf. loc. at 2nd callout
        0.9             ZVAL(3)   ref. surf. loc. at 3rd callout
        0.9             ZVAL(4)   ref. surf. loc. at 4th callout
      ==========================================================
      NTYPE, Z(i), and ZVAL(i) are defined next.

143.1 NTYPE = control for meaning of callout (2=z, 3=r)
143.2  
      See pp. P12-P15 for discussion and examples.
      NTYPE = 2 means callouts for reference surface location
                relative to shell wall material will be axial
                coordinates;
      NTYPE = 3 means callouts will be radial coordinates.

144.1 Z(I)  = axial coordinate of Ith callout, z
144.2  
      Specified points must include the first and last points
      in the segment. Values used should be consistent with
      those used for the input of the meridional geometry.
      Order of specification must be from the beginning to the
      end of the segment. If the callouts are specified by
      use of Z(I), the axial coordinate z must be single-
      valued over the entire segment.

145.1 R(I)  = radial coordinate of Ith callout, r
145.2  
      Specified points must include the first and last points
      in the segment. Values used should be consistent with
      those used for the input of the meridional geometry.
      Order of specification must be from the beginning to the
      end of the segment. If the callouts are specified by
      use of R(I), the axial coordinate R must be single-
      valued over the entire segment.

146.1 ZVAL  = distance from leftmost surf. to ref. surf.,ZVAL
146.2  
      See the figures on p. P17 and the discussion on p. P16.

147.1 ZVAL  = distance from leftmost surf. to reference surf.
147.2  
      See the figures on pp. P13, P15, and P17.

148.1 NRINGS= number (max=20) of discrete rings in this segment
148.2  
      Up to 20 rings are permitted in one segment; up to 99
      rings in the entire structure.  If line loads or imposed
      displacement components are applied at some station, you
      must supply a fake ring, even if no ring is actually
      present in the structure at that point.  This is because
      all line loads and imposed displacement components are
      considered to act at discrete ring centroids.

149.1 NTYPE = control for identification of ring location (2=z, 3=r)
149.2  
      NTYPE = 2 means that locations of discrete rings will be
      identified by axial coordinates, z(i), i= 1, NRINGS;

      NTYPE = 3 means that locations of discrete rings will be
      identified by radial coordinates, r(i), i=1, NRINGS.

150.1 Z(I)  = axial coordinate of Ith ring, z
150.2  
      Z(i)= axial coords. of ring attachment points, considered to be
      on the ref. surface. Values used should be consistent with
      those used for the input of the meridional geometry.
      Order of specification must be from the beginning to the
      end of the segment. If the callouts are specified by
      use of Z(I), the axial coordinate z must be single-
      valued over the entire segment.

151.1 R(I)  = radial coordinate of Ith ring, r
151.2  
      R(i)= radial coords. of ring attachment points, considered to
      be on the ref. surface. Values used should be consistent with
      those used for the input of the meridional geometry.
      Order of specification must be from the beginning to the
      end of the segment. If the callouts are specified by
      use of R(I), the axial coordinate R must be single-
      valued over the entire segment.

152.1 NTYPER= type (0 or 1 ) of discrete ring no.
152.2  
      0 means fake ring, needed as a place to "hang" a line load
      1 indicates the presence of a real ring.  Data for the Kth
        discrete ring in the current segment will be read in.
        The discrete ring is considered to be composed of a
        number of straight segments of uniform thickness. Control
        integers are first read in to determine whether or not a
        similar ring segment has been specified previously,
        either in this current shell segment or in a previous
        shell segment.  See pp. P20-P29 for input data.

153.1 NPARTS = number of segments in discrete ring no.
153.2  
      For example, NPARTS = 3 for the three-segment discrete
      ring shown on p. P21.
154.0
      Control integers for type of geometry (NGEOM), temperature
      distribution (NTEMP), material (NMATL), integration
      points (INTEG), and creep (NCREEP) are to be provided
      next for this ring segment.  Their purpose is to tell
      BOSOR5 whether or not certain properties have
      previously been specified, even if this previous
      specification is associated with a previous shell
      segment.  If they have, they needn't be specified
      again.  This spares you some effort if you are
      modeling a shell with many identical discrete rings.

155.1 NGEOM = geometry type of ring segment no.
155.2  
      If the geometry, as specified by the dimensions D1, D2,
      PHI, T, and FL (See p. P23) of this ring segment is
      different from any previously specified discrete ring
      segment, set NGEOM equal to one plus the highest value
      of NGEOM previously provided by you in this case. Note..
      The first NGEOM must be 1  .  If the geometry of this
      discrete ring segment is the same as that of some
      previously specified discrete ring segment, set NGEOM
      equal to the value of NGEOM which was first used when
      that earlier segment was first specified.

156.1 NTEMP = type of temperature distribution in ring seg.
156.2
      The temperature is assumed to be uniform through the
      thickness of the ring segment.  The way in which this
      control integer is used is analogous to that described
      for NGEOM.

157.1 NMATL = type of material for ring segment no.
157.2  
      Use integer between 1 and 9.
158.1 INTEG = number of integration points for ring seg.
158.2  
      Use 5 or 7 or 9.  Integration points are assumed by
      BOSOR5 to be equally spaced along the ring segment length.
      Simpson's rule is used for integrating.

      Note...Use of different values of INTEG in different
      ring segments requires corresponding re-specification
      of temperature distribution, even if this distribution
      is identical to that in a previous ring segment.  This
      is because the number of input quantities depends on
      INTEG.  It is probably best to choose a value for INTEG
      (5 is usually sufficient) and stay with it throughout
      the case.

159.1 NCREEP = control for creep of ring segment no.
159.2  
      NCREEP = 0 means ring material does not creep
      NCREEP = 1 means ring material does creep

160.1 NUMBT = number of temperature distributions in seg.
160.2  
      Must be 0 or 1 or 2 or 3.  You should usually use 0 or 1.
      You might want to use 2 or 3 in order to simulate multiple
      fabrication processes, such as cold bending followed by
      welding.

161.1 Are D1,D2,PHI,T,FL for this ring seg. same as for a previous?
162.1 D1 = radial distance to beginning of ring segment
162.2  
      Positive if the beginning of the ring segment lies
      at a greater distance from the shell axis of
      revolution than does the attachment point of the
      ring to the shell; negative otherwise (See p. P25).

163.1 D2 = axial distance to beginning of ring segment
163.2  
      Positive if the beginning of the ring segment lies
      above the attachment point of the ring to the shell;
      negative otherwise.

164.1 PHI = angle in degrees of ring segment
164.2  
      PHI is measured as shown in the figure on p. P25 .

165.1 T = thickness of ring segment 
165.2  
      T is assumed to be uniform.  T is always the dimension
      normal to the direction of integration (See p. P25)

166.1 FL = length of ring segment
166.2  
      FL is measured as shown in the fig. on p. P25.

167.1 Are TEMP1,TEMP2,TEMP3 identical to those of a previous seg.?
167.2 
      TEMP1, TEMP2, and TEMP3 are temperature rise distributions
      at integration points in the current discrete ring segment.
      Three different temperature distributions (TEMP1, TEMP2, and
      TEMP3) can be used for the same segment in order to simulate
      multiple fabrication processes, such as cold bending and
      subsequent welding of the rings to the shell.

168.1 TEMP1 = temperature rise at integration pt. no.
168.2  
      See the figure on p. P27.  TEMP1 (with the "1")
      corresponds to the first temperature distribution
      along the ring segment.  If fabrication effects
      are to be simulated, there may follow as many as
      two additional temperature distributions, TEMP2
      and TEMP3, each of which is specified by your
      providing values at all of the INTEG integration
      points in the ring segment.

169.1 TEMP2 = temperature rise at integration pt. no.
169.2  
      Corresponds to the second distribution along the
      same discrete ring segment.

170.1 TEMP3 = temperature rise at integration pt. no.
170.2  
      Corresponds to the third distribution along the
      same discrete ring segment.

171.1 Is this ring mat'l same as a previously specified ring mat'l?
172.1 E = elastic modulus of ring segment no.
173.1 ALPHA = thermal expansion coef. of ring segment no.
174.1 Can the material of this ring segment go plastic?
175.1 NPOINT = no. of points used for s-s curve of ring seg.
175.2  
      The stress-strain curve of the ring segment material
      can be specified with up to 20 points. Please include
      the (0, 0) point in your count of NPOINT. For purely
      elastic material you must still read in a stress-strain
      'curve'.  In such a case you can simply read NPOINT = 2
      and then give (for example) 0. and 1. for the strain
      coordinates and 0. and 10000000. for the stress
      coordinates, where 10000000. is the modulus of the segment.
      (See the figure at the bottom of p. P27).

176.1 EPSILON = strain coord. of the s-s curve, EPS
177.1 SIGMA   = stress coord. of the s-s curve, SIG
178.1 RN = time exponent in the creep law
179.1 RM = stress exponent in the creep law
180.1 RA = yield-stress-like quantity
181.1 RB = starting time (usually zero)
182.0  
      Coordinates  (XS, YS) of the discrete ring shear center
      must next be provided by you. (see Fig. on p.P28).
      XS and YS are measured relative to the attachment
      point of the ring on the reference surface of the shell.

183.1 XS = radial coordinate of shear center, ring no.
183.2  
      See the figure on the bottom of p. P28 .  XS is
      positive if the radius to shear center is larger than the
      radius to the ring attachment point on the shell
      reference surface; negative otherwise.

184.1 YS = axial coordinate of shear center, ring no.
184.2  
      Positive if shear center lies above the ring attachment
      point.

185.0  
      Next, provide control parameters for the manner in which
      the temperature in the ring segments varies with pseudo
      time (see pp. P30-P31 for explanation of "pseudo time").
      All the segments in a given ring must have the same time
      variation parameter...

186.1 STEPT1 = time variation parameter, temp. function type 1
186.2    
      By "temperature function type 1" is meant the spatial
      distribution, TEMP1, previously provided by you.
      The temperal variation indicator, STEPT1, is associated
      with TEMP1, so that the actual temperature in the various
      segments for this ring is given by

         Temperature = TEMP1(space) * Fi(time)

      in which Fi(time), the "ith function of time", is that
      function pointed to by the control parameter, STEPT1.

187.1 STEPT2 = time variation parameter, temp. function type 2
188.1 STEPT3 = time variation parameter, temp. function type 3
190.1 K=elastic foundation modulus (e.g. lb/in**3)in this seg.
190.2 
      Should be zero unless the shell is supported by an elastic
      foundation. Winkler foundation is assumed.  A Winkler
      foundation reacts only normal to the shell surface; it is
      like an array of closely spaced springs oriented normal to
      the shell surface.  Units of the foundation stiffness, K,
      are force per length cubed (lb/in**3, for example).
        
192.1 Do you want general information on loading?
200.0   
      The following input is related to loading of this
      segment.  All loads are considered to be axisymmetric
      and to be products of spatial times temporal functions.
      For example, the pressure, p(s,time), is given by:
        p(s,time) = Po(s) * f(time)
      in which s is the meridional arc length.  In this section
      you will be asked to provide only the spatial variation
      of the loads [e.g. Po(s) ] and pointers to the temporal
      variations, not the temporal variations  f(t) themselves.
      The f(t) to which the pointers point will be asked for
      after data for all the shell segments have been provided
      by you.  (See pp. P30-P31 for discussion and illustrations.)

      There are three types of loading: 
      1. temperature 
      2. normal pressure and meridional traction, and
      3. line loads and/or imposed displacement components
         applied at centroids of discrete rings.
220.0   
      Temperature rise (+) above or fall (-) below that
      corresponding to the zero stress state. You will be
      asked to provide distributions along the meridian
      and through the thickness. (See pp. P32-P39)

221.1 NTSTAT = number of temperature callout points along meridian
221.2   
      NTSTAT = 0 means no temperature distrib. to be specified;
      NTSTAT = 1 means temperature is uniform along meridian;
      NTSTAT > 1 means temperature is nonuniform along meridian.

      If NTSTAT > 1 you will be asked to provide callout points
      (See illustrations on p. P33 and p. P35).  BOSOR5 will
      automatically linearly interpolate between callout points.
      Make sure to include end points of the shell segment in
      determining NTSTAT.

222.1 NTHICK = no. of temperature callout points thru wall thick
222.2  
      NTHICK = 1 means temperature is uniform thru the thickness;
      NTHICK > 1 means temperature is nonuniform thru thickness.
      NTHICK must be less than or equal to the number of
      integration points to be used thru the wall thickness, a
      quantity which you have not decided upon yet (p. P54)

224.0  
      Next, input for temperature callout points on the meridian..

226.1 NTYPE = control for meaning of callout (2=z, 3=r)
226.2  
      See pp. P33 and P35 for examples.
      NTYPE = 2 means callouts for meridional variation of
                temperature will be axial coordinates;

      NTYPE = 3 means callouts will be radial coordinates.

227.1 Z(I)  = axial coordinate of Ith temperature callout, z
227.2  
      Specified points must include the first and last points
      in the segment. Values used should be consistent with
      those used for the input of the meridional geometry.
      Order of specification must be from the beginning to the
      end of the segment. If the callouts are specified by
      use of Z(I), the axial coordinate z must be single-
      valued over the entire segment.

228.1 R(I)  = radial coordinate of Ith temperature callout, r
228.2  
      Specified points must include the first and last points
      in the segment. Values used should be consistent with
      those used for the input of the meridional geometry.
      Order of specification must be from the beginning to the
      end of the segment. If the callouts are specified by
      use of R(I), the axial coordinate R must be single-
      valued over the entire segment.

232.0 
      Input for temperature thru the thickness at the
      meridional callout points...

234.0 Temperature thru thickness at meridional callout no.

236.1     TEMP(J)=temp. at Jth thickness station, J=
236.2  
      TEMP(J) must be read in the proper order, from left to
      right as you face in the direction of increasing
      meridional arc length, s.  (See p. P33 and p. P37)

238.0  
      Thickness coordinates corresponding to the values of
      the temperature already read in are to be input next.
      You do not read the values corresponding to the shell
      wall inner and outer surfaces, only those thickness
      coordinates corresponding to points within the wall
      material.  For example, if you have provided the
      temperature at 5 stations thru the thickness, including
      the temp. at the inner and outer surfaces of course,
      you will next only read 3 values for each meridional
      callout.  These must be in proper order, from left to
      right as you face in the direction of increasing
      meridional arc length, s.  (See figures on p. P37)

240.0 
      Thickness coordinates for meridional callout pt. no.

242.1 THICK(J)=distance from left surface to TEMP(J+1),J=
242.2 
      See the figure nearest the bottom of p. P37

244.1 IDTEMP = control integer for time variation of TEMP
244.2  
      The control integer, IDTEMP, is a pointer which will
      cause the appropriate function of time to be associated
      with the spatial temperature distribution that you have
      just provided.  Different functions of time can be
      associated with the temperature distributions in
      different shell segments.  The exact nature of these
      time functions will be asked of you later.  Right now
      all you need do is to specify 1 or 2 or 3, or other
      simple integer.  Start with an appropriate value which
      depends on what other loads you have already specified
      in this case up to now.  IDTEMP should be unity if this
      is the first 'load' ever specified in this case.

      Each time a new time function is to be introduced, use
      a higher integer (higher by 1) than has ever been used
      before to specify the time variation of any load, whether
      it be for a previously specified temperature distribution,
      pressure or surface traction distribution, or line load.
      This word 'previous' includes loads that you have
      specified in previous segments as well as those specified
      previously in the current segment.

246.0  
      Next, provide input for normal pressure and meridional
      traction...

247.1 NPSTAT = number of meridional callouts for pressure
247.2  
      NPSTAT = 0 means no pressure or meridional traction;
      NPSTAT = 1 means uniform distributed loading;
      NPSTAT > 1 means meridionally nonuniform loading.

      In determining NPSTAT, please include the endpoints
      of the shell segment.  BOSOR5 linearly interpolates
      the pressure and meridional traction between callout
      points that you will provide along the meridian.
      See the illustration at the top of p. P45.

248.1 PN = normal pressure, positive as shown on p. P41.
248.2 
      The normal pressure is positive if it pushes you to
      the right as you travel in the direction of increasing
      meridional arc length, s.  The actual pressure is
      represented as a product

         P  =  PN * f(time)

      in which the function of time remains to be specified.
      (See the comments on pp. P30 and P31.)

250.1 PT = meridional traction, positive along increasing s.
250.2  
      Note that PT must be associated with the same f(time)
      as PN, although of course its amplitude may be different
      from that of PN.  (PT is usually zero.)

252.0 
      Next provide meridional callout points for pressure...

254.1 NTYPE = control for meaning of loading callout (2=z, 3=r)
254.2  
      See p. P43 for an illustration.
      NTYPE = 2 means callouts for meridional variation of
                surface traction and pressure will be axial
                coordinates;
      NTYPE = 3 means callouts will be radial coordinates.

255.1 Z(I)  = axial coordinate of Ith loading callout, z
255.2  
      Specified points must include the first and last points
      in the segment. Values used should be consistent with
      those used for the input of the meridional geometry.
      Order of specification must be from the beginning to the
      end of the segment. If the callouts are specified by
      use of Z(I), the axial coordinate z must be single-
      valued over the entire segment.

256.1 R(I)  = radial coordinate of Ith loading callout, r
256.2  
      Specified points must include the first and last points
      in the segment. Values used should be consistent with
      those used for the input of the meridional geometry.
      Order of specification must be from the beginning to the
      end of the segment. If the callouts are specified by
      use of R(I), the axial coordinate R must be single-
      valued over the entire segment.

258.0 
      Next provide normal pressure and meridional traction
      at the meridional callouts...

260.1 PN(J)= normal pressure at meridional callout pt. no.
260.2  
      PN is positive as shown in the top figure on p. P45.
      Pressure between callouts is calculated by BOSOR5 by
      linear interpolation.  The actual pressure is a product

         P = PN * f(time)

      in which the function of time f(time) remains to be
      specified.

262.1 PT(J)= meridional traction at callout point no.
262.2  
      PT is positive as shown in the lower fig. on p. P45.

264.1 ISTEP = control integer for time variation of pressure
264.2 
      Note that the same time function is to be associated
      with both the normal pressure and the meridional
      traction.

      The control integer, ISTEP, is a pointer which will
      cause the appropriate function of time to be associated
      with the spatial pressure distribution that you have
      just provided.  Different functions of time can be
      associated with the pressure distributions in
      different shell segments.  The exact nature of these
      time functions will be asked of you later.  Right now
      all you need do is to specify 1 or 2 or 3, or other
      simple integer.  Start with an appropriate value which
      depends on what other loads you have already specified
      in this case up to now.  ISTEP should be unity if this
      is the first load ever specified in this case.

      Each time a new time function is to be introduced, use
      a higher integer (higher by 1) than has ever been used
      before to specify the time variation of any load, whether
      it be for a previously specified temperature distribution,
      pressure or surface traction distribution, or line load.
      This word 'previous' includes loads that you have
      specified in previous segments as well as those specified
      previously in the current segment.

265.1 Do you want to print out distributed loads along meridian?
266.0  
      Next, please provide applied line loads and/or imposed
      axisymmetric displacement components for this shell segment...

268.1 LINTYP=control for line loads or disp.(0=none,1=some)
268.2 
      Line loads must always be associated with a discrete ring,
      and they are assumed to act at the discrete ring centroid,
      as shown in the Fig. at the bottom of p. P47.  Note that
      hydrostatic pressure gives rise to line loads, pr/2, at
      the ends of the shell structure, thus requiring you to use
      LINTYP = 1 for those segments in which pr/2 acts.

      Imposed axisymmetric displacement components (USTAR, WSTAR,
      CHI, see page P66, left-hand top for positive values) must
      always be associated with a discrete ring. In the following
      input for loading:
            V(K) can mean axial load or axial displacement
                 (note: positive V (load) [p. P47] is in opposite
                        direction from positive V (displacement)
                        [USTAR on p. P66]  )
           HF(K) can mean radial load or radial displacement
           FM(K) can mean meridional moment or meridional rotation

269.1 Any axial loads or imposed axial disp. in this seg.?
270.1 V(K)=axial disp. or load/length of circ. at ring no.
270.2  
      Line load is positive as shown in Fig. on p. P47.
      Imposed displacement positive as shown on p. P66 (USTAR)
      The actual line load or imposed axial displacement is the
      product:

           V = V(K)*F1(time)

      in which F1(time) remains to be specified.

271.1 ISTEP1 = pointer to time function associated with V
271.2  
      The control integer, ISTEP1, is a pointer which will
      cause the appropriate function of time to be associated
      with the axial line load/length V(K) or imposed
      axisymmetric axial displacement component that you have
      just provided.  Different functions of time can be
      associated with different axial line loads V(J) in
      this segment and other segments.  The exact nature of these
      time functions will be asked of you later.  Right now
      all you need do is to specify 1 or 2 or 3, or other
      simple integer.  Start with an appropriate value which
      depends on what other loads you have already specified
      in this case up to now.  ISTEP1 should be unity if this
      is the first load ever specified in this case.

      Each time a new time function is to be introduced, use
      a higher integer (higher by 1) than has ever been used
      before to specify the time variation of any load, whether
      it be for a previously specified temperature distribution,
      pressure or surface traction distribution, or line load.
      This word 'previous' includes loads that you have
      specified in previous segments as well as those specified
      previously in the current segment.

271.3 Note... If there is an axial line load V(K) which arises
      because of hydrostatic pressure, that is, if

          V(K) = PN*R/2.

      then ISTEP1(K) should equal ISTEP, which is the pointer
      associated with the pressure time function.  See the 
      example on p. P49.

272.1 Any radial loads or imposed radial disp. in this seg.?
273.1 HF(K)=radial disp. or load/length of circ. at ring no.
273.2  
      HF(K) is positive as shown in Fig. on p. P47. Imposed radial
      displacement is positive as shown on p. P66 (WSTAR).
      Actual radial line load or imposed radial displacement is
      the product:

          H   =  HF(K)*F2(time)

      in which F2(time) remains to be specified.

274.1 ISTEP2 = pointer to the F(time) associated with HF
274.2  
      Please see the notes associated with ISTEP1.

275.1 Any applied meridional rotat. or moments in this seg.?
276.1 FM(K)=merid. rot. or moment/circ. at ring no.
276.2  
      FM(K) is positive as shown in Fig. on p. P47.  Imposed
      meridional rotation is positive as shown on p. P66 (CHI).
      Actual meridional moment or imposed meridional rotation
      is the product:

          M   =  FM(K)*F3(time)

      in which F3(time) remains to be specified.

280.1 ISTEP3 = pointer to the F(time) associated with FM
280.2 
      Please see the notes associated with ISTEP1.

282.0 
      Input for orthotropic layered wall construction follows.
      Note...circumferential or meridional stiffeners can be
      included by smearing their properties as shown on p. P55
      and as described below.

284.1 Do you want to include smeared stiffeners?
285.1 Do you want information about smeared stiffeners?
286.0  
      Either smeared rings or smeared stringers are permitted, not
      both, unless the rings and stringers are on opposite sides of
      the shell wall.

      Smeared stiffeners are treated in BOSOR5 as multiple
      orthotropic shell wall layers with effective material
      properties that depend on the actual stiffener material
      properties, dimensions of the stiffener cross section, and
      spacing between the stiffeners.  The effective shell wall
      layers representing each set of smeared stiffeners have
      stiffness only in one coordinate direction.  [ E(circum.)=0
      for smeared stringer layers and E(axial) = 0 for smeared
      ring layers.]  The shear modulus and Poisson's ratio = 0.

      The numbering of the layers of the shell wall plus smeared
      stiffeners starts with layer no. 1 on the inside surface
      (leftmost surface as you face in the direction of increasing
      meridional arc length, s).  For example, the flange of an
      internal ring with a T-shaped cross section would be layer
      no. 1; the same flange for an external ring would have the
      highest layer number.

288.1 Do you want to include smeared stringers (axial stiff.)?
289.1 Are the stringers internal (on the left side of the shell)?
290.1 Indicate type of stringer cross section (1 or 2 or 3)
290.2  
          1 indicates rectangular cross section;
          2 indicates T shaped or L shaped cross section;
          3 indicates I shaped or [ shaped cross section.

292.1 Do you want to include smeared rings?
293.1 Are the rings internal (on the left side of the shell)?
294.1 Indicate type of ring cross section (1 or 2 or 3)
294.2  
          1 indicates rectangular cross section;
          2 indicates T shaped or L shaped cross section;
          3 indicates I shaped or [ shaped cross section.

295.1 Do you want more information on smeared stringer modeling?
296.1 Do you want more information on smeared ring modeling?
      
298.0  
      Stiffeners of rectangular cross section are treated as one
      wall layer, with thickness equal to the height of the
      stiffeners; effective modulus E(eff) given by

             E(eff) = E(actual) * (t/b)

      in which t is the stiffener thickness and b the spacing
      between stiffeners; and the stress coordinates of the
      stress-strain curve of the stiffener material are reduced
      by the factor (t/b) while the strain coordinates remain
      unchanged.
300.0  
      Smeared stiffeners with T or L shaped cross sections are
      treated as two wall layers, one for the web ("web layer")
      and the other for the flange ("flange layer").  The
      thickness of the "web layer" is equal to the height of the
      web; the effective modulus of the "web layer", E(web eff),
      is given by
           E(web eff) = E(web actual) * [t(web)/b]
      in which t(web) is the thickness of the web and b is the
      spacing between stiffeners; and the stress coordinates of
      the stress-strain curve of the web material are reduced
      by the factor [t(web)/b]
      while the strain coordinates remain unchanged.  The
      thickness of the "flange layer" is equal to the thickness of
      the flange; the effective modulus of the "flange layer",
      E(flange eff), is given by
         E(flange eff) = E(flange actual) * [h(flange)/b]
      in which h(flange) is the height of the flange and b is the
      spacing between stiffeners; and the stress coordinates of
      the stress-strain curve of the flange material are reduced by
      the factor [h(flange)/b] while the strain coordinates remain
      unchanged.
302.0  
      Smeared stiffeners with I or [ shaped cross sections are
      treated as three wall layers, one for the faying flange
      ("flange layer"), one for the web ("web layer"), and one
      for the flange away from the skin ("flange layer").  The
      thickness of the "web layer" is equal to the height of the
      web; the effective modulus of the "web layer", E(web eff),
      is given by
           E(web eff) = E(web actual) * [t(web)/b]
      in which t(web) is the thickness of the web and b is the
      spacing between stiffeners; and the stress coordinates of
      the stress-strain curve are reduced by the factor [t(web)/b]
      while the strain coordinates remain unchanged.  The
      thickness of each "flange layer" is equal to the thickness of
      each flange; the effective modulus of each "flange layer",
      E(flange eff), is given by
         E(flange eff) = E(flange actual) * [h(flange)/b]
      in which h(flange) is the height of each flange and b is the
      spacing between stiffeners; and the stress coordinates of
      the stress-strain curve of each flange are reduced by the
      factor [h(flange)/b] while the strain coordinates remain
      unchanged.
305.1 LAYERS = number of layers (max. = 6)
305.2  
      Be sure to include in LAYERS any layers corresponding
      to smeared stringers and/or smeared rings.
      Layers are numbered from left-to-right, as shown in the
      figure on the bottom of p. P51.  "left" and "right" are
      based on the assumption that you are facing in the direction
      of increasing meridional arc length, s.

308.1 Are all the layers of constant thickness?
312.1 MATL = type of material for shell wall layer no.
312.2  
      Layers are numbered from left-to-right, as shown in the
      figure on the bottom of p. P51. "left" and "right" are
      based on the assumption that you are facing in the
      direction of increasing meridional arc length, s.

      Layers corresponding to parts of smeared stiffeners must
      each be associated with a new material index number.

313.1 T(i) = thickness of ith layer (i=1 = leftmost), T
315.1 G(i) = shear modulus of ith layer, G
316.1 EX(i)= modulus in meridional direction, EX
317.1 EY(i)= modulus in circumferential direction, EY
318.1 UXY(i)= Poisson's ratio (EY*UXY = EX*UYX).   UXY
320.1 ALPHA1(i)=coef. thermal exp. in merid. direction, ALPHA1
321.1 ALPHA2(i)=coef. thermal exp. in circ. direction, ALPHA2
330.1 Do you wish to include plasticity in this segment?
340.1 Do you wish to include creep in this segment?
350.1 Is this a new shell wall material?
430.0 
      Stress-strain curve for material in shell layer no.

432.1 NPOINT = number of points in s.s.curve, layer no.
432.2  
      Please include the stress,strain coordinate (0, 0) in
      your determination of a value for NPOINT. NPOINT must
      be greater than or equal to 2 and less than 20.  If the
      material is elastic rather than elastic-plastic, use
      NPOINT = 2; use 0. and 1. for the strain coordinates; and
      use 0. and E (Young's modulus) for the stress coordinates.
      See p. P55 for examples.

434.1 NITEG=no. integration pts. thru thickness, layer no.
434.2  
      Use 3 or 5 or 7 or 9 .  5 is usually sufficient unless you are
      simulating residual stress patterns due to cold bending.  3 is
      good for flanges of stringers or rings that are modelled as a
      shell wall layer (smeared out).

435.1 Do you want to use power law for stress-strain curve?
435.2  
      (Effective strain is calculated from user-provided
       values of effective stress.  The power law is as follows:

       ebar = (Sbar/E)[1 +(3/7)(Sbar/Syp)**power]

436.1 SYP = yield stress (.2%) of material in layer no.
438.1 POWER=power in power law for strain as f(stress)
438.2  
      See SUBROUTINE CFB5 for the actual formula used in
      BOSOR5 for this branch.  You can change this formula
      to suit yourself.

      The formula for effective strain in terms of effective
      stress is now as follows...

       ebar = (Sbar/E)[1 +(3/7)(Sbar/Syp)**power]

440.1 EPS(i)=strain coordinates of s-s curve, EPS
442.1 SIG(i)=stress coordinates of s-s curve, SIG
444.1 CREEPN=time power for creep law, layer no.
444.2  
      See p. P57 for creep law.  Effective creep strain is
      in per cent, which is different from the way the
      stress-strain curve has been provided by you.

446.1 CREEPM = stress power for creep law (See p. P57)
448.1 CREEPA = stress coefficient in creep law (p. P57)
450.1 CREEPB = initial time for creep law (p. P57)

      Next, provide data for meridionally varying thickness...

462.1 NTIN = number of meridional callouts for variable thickness
462.2  
      Range of NTIN is 2 to 20
463.1 NTYPE = control for meaning of thickness callout (2=z, 3=r)
463.2  
      See pp. P57, P59 for further discussion and examples.
      NTYPE = 2 means callouts for meridional variation of
                thickness will be axial coordinates;

      NTYPE = 3 means callouts will be radial coordinates.

464.1 Z(I)  = axial coordinate of Ith thickness callout, z
464.2  
      Specified points must include the first and last points
      in the segment. Values used should be consistent with
      those used for the input of the meridional geometry.
      Order of specification must be from the beginning to the
      end of the segment. If the callouts are specified by
      use of Z(I), the axial coordinate z must be single-
      valued over the entire segment.

465.1 R(I)  = radial coordinate of Ith thickness callout, r
465.2  
      Specified points must include the first and last points
      in the segment. Values used should be consistent with
      those used for the input of the meridional geometry.
      Order of specification must be from the beginning to the
      end of the segment. If the callouts are specified by
      use of R(I), the axial coordinate R must be single-
      valued over the entire segment.

      You will next be asked to provide input for the thicknesses
      of each layer at each of the callout points. Please provide
      thicknesses at all callouts for layer 1 (leftmost layer)
      first, then provide thicknesses at all callouts for layer 2,
      and so on.

468.1 TIN(i) = thickness at Ith callout, TIN
470.1 Do you want to have C(i,j) printed for this segment?
