320.1 Choose an index (1 or 2 or . . .  14)
490.1 Do you want to reverse the rate of loading?
490.2  
      For example, you may wish to unload from the latest
      converged step or from some earlier step.

494.0  
      Unloading from previously plastically deformed states may
      cause numerical difficulties that are associated mainly with
      BOSOR5's using an inappropriate tangent stiffness at the first
      unloading step. Pick the step KSTEP and corresponding time
      TIME from which you wish to unload and follow one of two
      stategies (1 or 2).

496.1 Choose the unloading strategy  1   or   2   (or H)
496.2  
      The two unloading strategies are as follows:
      1  Do two executions of the mainprocessor:  In the first,  set
         KMAX = KSTEP + 1, ITIME = 1, DTIME = 0.  In the second, set
         KSTEP = previous KSTEP + 1, TIME = previous TIME, ITIME = 1,
         and  DTIME = some negative value appropriate to the case,
         and  KMAX  = some value greater than KSTEP appropriate to
         the case.
         The first mainprocessor run essentially resets the stiffness
         to the elastic value and the second mainprocessor run unloads
         the structure.

      2  Make only a single mainprocessor run, with ITIME = 1, an
         appropriate negative value for DTIME and positive value for
         KMAX (KMAX > KSTEP, of course). If you choose this strategy,
         plastic flow will be prevented by an internally set switch.

      Strategy 1 is preferred.

      Your structure may contain segments that are very short
      compared to the whole model being analyzed here. This detail
      will not show up well in plots of the entire undeformed and
      deformed structure. Therefore you may wish to get expanded
      plots of these regions. Please identify these regions by
      segment number and give a magnification factor for each region.
      Note that the magnification factor must be an integer.
      The center of the expanded plot will be at the first point of
      the segment so identified. The extent of structure plotted
      will of course depend on the magnification factor you choose.

510.1 Are there any regions for which you want expanded plots?
520.1 Any more regions for which you want expanded plots?
530.1 Segment number for segment at center of expanded region
530.2  
      The first point in the segment will be at the center of
      the expanded plot.

540.1 Magnification factor (integer) for this expanded region
540.2  
      Use integers such as 5, 10, etc. Value depends on how much
      of the structure you want to include in the expanded region.
      A factor of unity would merely give you the entire structure
      again, so the smallest factor is 2.

550.1 Are you correcting, adding to, or checking an existing file?
550.2  
      If you are starting a new segment or starting the section on
      global variables and constraint conditions, the answer should
      be NO.

      Note that you may only add entries after the last entry in the
      existing file. In order to change the file in other respects,
      you must edit it using the VAX edit mode.  Make sure that when
      you use VAX editing that the version number of the file remains
      unchanged.

555.1 Indicate what kind of file you are editing (1 or 2)
555.2  
      1 indicates a file containing data for one of the segments
        of the structure, and global data that precede data
        for Segment 1;

      2 indicates the file containing global data and constraint
        conditions which follow all the segment data.

560.1 Indicate what kind of file you are adding to (1 or 2)
560.2
      1 indicates a file containing data for one of the segments
        of the structure;

      2 indicates the file containing global data and constraint
        conditions.

570.1 Which segment is this?
575.1 For which segment are you modifying the constraints?
580.1 How many segments in the structure?
582.1 Do you have a complete tori-ellipsoidal dome?
582.2
      If you answer "Y", BOSOR5 reflects the right-hand portion,
      input for which is depicted on p.P9 of the BOSOR5 user's manual,
      over to the left side of the centerline of the dome, and the
      total arc length of the segment becomes double that of the
      segment you just provided geometry input data for. Note that
      you are permitted to answer "Y" only if the dome is closed at
      its apex.

      NOTE: INPUT FOR BOUNDARY AND/OR JUNCTION CONDITIONS MAY BE
            VERY TRICKY DUE TO POSSIBLE AUTOMATED MODIFICATION OF THE
            NUMBER OF NODAL POINTS IN THE "DOUBLED" TORI-ELLIPSOIDAL
            SEGMENT. IT IS BEST IF YOU ALWAYS USE:
                     NMESH  between 51 and 97 (preferably 97)
            FOR THE NUMBER OF NODES IN THIS SEGMENT. THEN THE END OF
            THE NEW "DOUBLED" SEGMENT WILL AUTOMATICALLY HAVE THE
            SAME NODAL POINT NUMBER, NMESH, THAT YOU JUST SPECIFIED
            IN YOUR INPUT SESSION.  IF YOU ALWAYS USE NMESH = 97,
            THERE WILL PROBABLY ALWAYS BE ENOUGH NODES IN THE "DOUBLED"
            SEGMENT TO AVOID ELEMENT LOCKING.
      NOTE2:WHEN USING CALLOUTS, ALWAYS USE r (NOT z) AND FOR A CLOSED
            TOROID FOLLOW THE INPUT SCHEME LISTED IN THE EXAMPLE IN
            THE FILE ...bosor5/doc/bosor5.news, ITEM 2, DATED NOV 1995.

584.1 Is this segment an INNER part of the toroid?
584.2 
      By "INNER" is meant the part of the toroid with negative
      Gaussian curvature, the portion of the toroid with radius
      less than the radius, ALPHAT, to the center of the toroid.

      The OUTER part of the toroid is the part with positive
      Gaussian curvature, the portion of the toroid with radius
      greater than the radius, ALPHAT, to the center of the toroid.
