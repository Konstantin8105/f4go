1.0   BOSOR5 INPUT DATA, INTERACTIVE MODE

      Initial prompts are short, and contain data names a new user
      will not be familiar with.  Please type HELP or H instead of
      any datum called for, and you will get more information on that
      datum.

      Page numbers contained in some of the prompts refer to the
      original BOSOR5 user's manual, "BOSOR5--a computer program
      for buckling of elastic-plastic complex shells of revolution
      including large deflections and creep", Lockheed Missiles &
      Space Co. Report LMSC-D407166, December 1974, Vol. 1: User's
      manual, input data.  This user's manual contains additional
      discussion and figures.

      NOTE:  This version of BOSOR5 will handle up to 200 shell
             segments, rather than the 25 stated as a limit in the
             user's manual.

2.1   INDIC = analysis type indicator (0 or -2 or -3). INDIC
2.2  
       0= nonlinear axisymmetric stress (and collapse) analysis;
      -2= axisymmetric prebuckling states and stability determinant
          are calculated for several load  (time) steps. (See p. M3)
      -3= stability determinant is calculated for a case in which
          prebuckling states have been obtained in a previous run.
          See p. M5.

3.1   Type HELP or H for more information on INDIC, N for "no more"
3.2    
      INDIC=0 means that nonlinear axisymmetric stress analysis
      will be performed for a sequence of time (load) steps
      specified by you either in the BOSOR5 preprocessor or in
      the following. The results for every time step are saved so
      that the case can be restarted at any time step. It is also
      possible to restart with a different value of INDIC.

      INDIC = -2 means that a nonlinear axisymmetric stress
      analysis will be performed and that the stability determinant
      will be calculated for several time steps for a certain
      fixed number, N0B, of circumferential waves. If the stability
      determinant for N0B waves changes sign in the user-specified
      time range, then bifurcation buckling loads are calculated
      for a range of circumferential wave numbers, NMINB through
      NMAXB in increments of INCRB, with NMINB, NMAXB, INCRB to be
      provided by you.  See the figure at the bottom of p. M3.
      (Type H for more help, N for no more.)

3.3   INDIC = -2 (continued)  If the stability determinant does
      not change sign eigenvalues for the range NMINB to NMAXB are
      still computed.  In either case (whether or not the
      stability determinant changes sign) you should pursue the
      buckling analysis in a restart for a new circumferential
      wavenumber: that wavenumber corresponding to the minimum
      eigenvalue, as shown in Fig (3) at the bottom of p. M3.

      INDIC = - 3 means that the stability determinant for a given
      number, N0B, of circumferential waves will be calculated for
      a sequence of time steps for which the prebuckling analysis
      was done in a previous run with INDIC = 0 or INDIC = -2.
      Bifurcation buckling loads are calculated for a user-
      provided range, NMINB to NMAXB, of circumferential wavenumbers
      as described above.
      (Type H for more information on INDIC, N for no more.)

3.4   Note...In problems involving bifurcation buckling in the
      plastic range of material behavior, the actual values of
      the eigenvalues obtained by BOSOR5 are not too meaningful.
      The sign of the eigenvalues and their relationship to
      eachother (that is, for which circumferential wave number
      is there a minimum eigenvalue) are important, however.
      Briefly, the eigenvalue analysis in BOSOR5 has two purposes:

        1. to help the search for a minimum buckling load
           with respect to the number of circumferential waves;
   
        2. to yield buckling mode shapes, which guide the
           engineer toward a better design.

4.1   NLAST = plot options  (-1=none, 0=geometry, 1=u,v,w)
4.2     
      NLAST = -1 means no plotting;
               0 means plots of undeformed and deformed
                 geometry only;
               1 means plots of geometry and u,v,w vs arc length.

5.1   IDEFORM=indicator (0 or 1) for type of plasticity theory
5.2    
      IDEFORM = 0 means that flow theory will be used to
                  calculate the constitutive law for both
                  the prebuckling and the bifurcation buckling
                  analyses;

      IDEFORM = 1 means that flow theory will be used in the
                  prebuckling analysis and deformation theory
                  in the bifurcation buckling analysis.

      NOTE...In order to run INDIC = -3 with deformation theory you
             must have previously run INDIC = -2 with IDEFORM = 1.

6.1   ICPRE = control (0 or 1) for type of eigenvalue problem
6.2    
      In cases for which all loads (and temperatures) vary
      with pseudo-time in the same proportion, use ICPRE = 1.
      Otherwise, use ICPRE = 0. For more details see the
      discussion on the right-hand side of p. 407 of the paper
      by Lagae and Bushnell, "Elastic-plastic buckling of
      torispherical vessel heads", Nuclear Engineering and Design,
      Vol. 48 (1978) pp 405-414

7.1   KSTEP = starting time step number
7.2    
      If this is the first run (not a restart) KSTEP must be 0.
      If this is a restart, then KSTEP must be equal to a value
      for which prebuckling results have already been obtained
      in a previous run. (After the first run, KSTEP = 1
      corresponds to the first time step.

8.1   KMAX = maximum (less than 49) time step number
8.2   
      As a rule of thumb, do less than 10 time steps per run.
      Look at your results after each run and make use of the
      restart capability.

9.1   MAXTRL =  maximum number of trials at each load level
9.2   
      The figure on p. M7 explains what is meant by a "trial".  In
      BOSOR5 several trials for a converged solution are attempted
      at each time step (level of loading). The purpose of each
      trial is to obtain updated material properties. Use between
      3 and 10, usually closer to 3 for best results.

10.1  NSEG  = number of shell segments (less than 95)
11.1  ITMAX = maximum number of Newton iterations for each trial
11.2   
      ITMAX between 4 and 10 is recommended. 6 is a good number.

12.1  ITIME = control (0 or 1) for time increments
12.2  
      ITIME = 0 means use time increment(s) specified in
                the preprocessor;
      ITIME = 1 means use a new time increment 

13.1  NSTEPS = quantity of time steps for stability calculation
13.2   
      Must be consistent with number of time steps for which
      prebuckling states have been obtained in previous runs.

14.1  LSTEPS(i)=time step number for buckling, Step no.
14.2   
      Prebuckling state must exist for this time step from
      a previous run with INDIC = 0 or INDIC = -2.

15.1  TIMES(i)=time corresponding to LSTEP(i), Step no.
16.0  
      Sometimes, during initial unloading, you may need to force the
      behavior to be elastic because of numerical difficulty. This is
      especially true of elastic-perfectly plastic materials, or of
      materials with only small post-yield hardening.  For loading
      increments or decrements in this run, you can force the
      incremental straining of the material to be elastic.
        
16.1  Do you wish to force the material to remain elastic?
16.2   
      Usual answer is N.  If you are having numerical difficulty
      you may want to answer Y.
       
17.1  N0B   = starting number of circ. waves (buckling analysis)
17.2  
      Make N0B your best current estimate of the critical
      circumferential wavenumber.  See pp. M12 and M13 for
      estimates.

18.1  NMINB = minimum number of circ. waves  (buckling analysis)
19.1  NMAXB = maximum number of circ. waves  (buckling analysis)
20.1  INCRB = increment in number of circ. waves (buckling)
20.2  
      INCRB should be about 10 per cent of the average of NMINB
      and NMAXB for efficient use of the computer.  You wouldn't
      need to increase the circumferential wave number by 1 if
      the critical wavenumber were in the neighborhood of 30 to
      100, for example.


21.1  TIME = starting time (need not be zero in initial run)
21.2   
      Note... TIME must be less than TMAX (see preprocessor)

22.1  DTIME = new time increment
22.2   
      In buckling cases it is good strategy to run initially
      with fairly large time increments in order to obtain an
      approximation of the buckling load.  The time increment
      can easily be reduced in restarts, so that a sharp
      definition of the buckling load can be obtained later.

23.1  Do you want stations where plastic flow occurs listed?
23.2  
      The segment numbers and point numbers within each segment
      where plastic flow occurs are listed for every load step.

24.0  
      Next, provide data which pertain to the entire structure,
      such as time variation of loads, boundary conditions, and
      junction conditions...

25.1  Do you want information on time functions for loading?
26.0  Data for time variation of loads is next.  In common
      cases (no creep, all loads varying proportionally and
      generally increasing until bifurcation buckling or
      collapse occurs) it is advisable to identify "time"
      directly with "load" and time increment with load
      increment.  Hence, whenever possible, the loading
      functions of time should be set equal to the time:

               f(time) = time

      In this way you will be able to read the load directly
      from the output; "TIME" will be the same as "load".
      Please refer to pp. P30-P31 for examples.

28.1  IUTIME = control for time increment (0 or 1). IUTIME
28.2  
      0 means time increment varies during case
      1 means time increment is constant during case.

      Please see the examples on pp. P30-P31 and pp. P61-P63.
      For most cases (except perhaps those involving creep) you
      will want to set IUTIME = 1.

30.1  DTIME = time increment
30.2  
      See the discussion on pp. P30-P31.  If you have a situation
      in which all loads are being increased in proportion, then
      it is best to set the time increment equal to the increment
      of what you feel to be the most important load component of
      the case. (e.g. external pressure increment).  For example,
      if you think a shell will collapse at about 100 psi, then
      you might wish to reach 100 psi in 10-psi increments. The
      time increment, DTIME, you would then set equal to 10.  For
      most cases, DTIME doesn't signify a real time increment; TIME
      in BOSOR5 is just a convenient parameter to use for provision
      of applied loads that vary nonproportionally during a case. In
      cases involving creep, TIME is real time, of course.

32.1  TMAX = maximum time to be encountered during this case
32.2  
      As with DTIME, you associate TMAX with the most important
      load component and set it equal to the largest value of that
      load component that could possibly be of any interest at
      all.  Overestimate here.  For example, if you think the
      shell you are studying might collapse at 100 psi, use TMAX
      of about 10000 or 100000.

34.0   
      Input data for time increments that vary during a case
      follow...

36.1  NTIME = no. of points in time for which DTIME is specified
36.2  
      See the example on p. P61. NTIME must be greater than 2
      and less than 50. Time increment at every point in time is
      automatically determined by linear interpolation between
      times for which the time increment is specified.

38.1  TIME(i)=time for which DTIME(i) is to be specified
38.2  
      See the fig. on P61.

40.1  DTIME(i)=time increment following TIME(i). DTIME
42.0  
      Next, specify the various time functions associated with
      the loads on the structure. These are the fi(time) to which
      the pointers, ISTEP, IDTEMP, etc. point.

44.1  NFTIME= number of different functions of time
44.2  
      For example, you may have a case involving a temperature
      distribution which is constant with time and a pressure
      distribution which varies linearly with time.  In such a
      case, NFTIME = 2, since there are two functions of time,
      one function (the temperature) a constant and the other
      (the pressure) a varying quantity (See example, p. P30).

      NFTIME must be equal to the highest value of any of the
      pointers, IDTEMP, ISTEP, ISTEP1, ISTEP2, ISTEP3, which
      were specified in the sections on temperature and
      loading input. (See page P38 for IDTEMP, p. P44 for ISTEP,
      p. P46 for ISTEP1, ISTEP2, ISTEP3.)

45.0  
      Next, please provide the time variations of loading which
      correspond to the pointers IDTEMP, ISTEP, etc. that you
      have already given. Each time-varying load factor is to be
      provided by you in the form of a vector of time callouts,
      T(i,j), j=1,NPOINT, followed by a vector of corresponding
      load factors F(i,j), j=1,NPOINT, where i = 1, 2, 3...NFTIME.
      The index j is in the inner loop.

46.1  NPOINT=no. of points j for ith load factor F(i,j). i=
46.2  
      NPOINT must be greater than or equal to 2 and less than
      or equal to 50.  For constant or linearly varying loads
      NPOINT should be 2.  See p. P63 for an example. In 
      common cases, the time increase is identified directly
      with the load increase: time = load, essentially. In
      such a case, NPOINT = 2.

48.0 
      Next, provide the vector of times T(i,j). i=

50.1  T(i,j)=jth time callout for ith time function, j =
50.2  
      T(i,j) must be less than or equal to TMAX.

51.0
      Next, provide the vector of load factors F(i,j). i=

52.1  F(i,j)=jth value for ith load factor. j =
52.2  
      For common cases (no creep) it is advisable to identify
      the load factor F(i,j) with time T(i,j).  Thus,

           F(i,j) = T(i,j) ; in other words, f(time) = time

      Then in the output when "time" is printed, you will know
      directly what the load is.

58.1  Do you want general information on constraint conditions?
60.0  
      Four kinds of constraint conditions exist in BOSOR5:
  
       1. constraints to ground (e.g. boundary conditions)
       2. juncture compatibility conditions
       3. regularity conditions at poles (where radius r = 0)
       4. constraints to prevent rigid body displacements
  
      See the figs. on p. P67, for example. There is a constraint
      to ground (boundary condition) at Seg. 8, Point 8; there are
      several juncture conditions (e.g. Seg. 2, Pt. 1 is connected
      to Seg. 1, Pt. 9); there are several poles (e.g. Seg. 1,
      Pt. 1).  Note that if a shell is not anywhere attached to
      ground, such as is the case for the example shown on p. P75,
      you must choose a node at which to prevent rigid body
      motion.  You must choose this node in the section below where
      you are asked about constraints to ground. In a section
      following the "constraints-to-ground" section, you will
      be asked to provide specific data for preventing rigid body
      motion.  Types of rigid body motion are shown on p. P73. An
      example of appropriate input data is listed on p. P75, bottom.
    
61.1  How many segments are there in the structure?
62.1  Number of poles (places where r=0) in SEGMENT
62.2    
      Your response should probably be 0 or 1.

64.1  IPOLE = nodal point number of pole, IPOLE
66.1  At how many stations is this segment constrained to ground?
66.2  
      This count does not include poles. Multiple constraints to
      ground within any one segment must be spaced at intervals of
      at least 3 nodal points.

68.1  INODE = nodal point number of constraint to ground, INODE
70.1  IUSTAR=axial displacement constraint (0 or 1 or 2)
70.2   
      The nature of the constraint condition is governed by four
      integers which, in the case of a connection to ground, 
      indicate whether USTAR, VSTAR, WSTAR, and CHI are free 
      or constrained to be zero or forced to have certain finite
      values. For example, IUSTAR may be 0 or 1 or 2 :
         IUSTAR = 0 means that USTAR is free at the node INODE
         IUSTAR = 1 means that USTAR   =  0  at the node INODE
         IUSTAR = 2 means that USTAR is imposed at  node INODE
      For example, simple support at the node INODE on a cylindrical
      shell is indicated by:
         IUSTAR = 0 (axial displacement USTAR is free)
         IVSTAR = 1 (circumferential displacement VSTAR is zero)
         IWSTAR = 1 (radial displacement WSTAR is zero)
         ICHI   = 0 (meridional rotation CHI is free)
      An example of imposed axial displacement is:
         IUSTAR = 2 (axial displacement USTAR is imposed)
         IVSTAR = 0 (circumferential displacement VSTAR is free)
         IWSTAR = 0 (radial displacement WSTAR is free)
         ICHI   = 1 (meridional rotation CHI is zero)
      Note that the constraints are applied in an (axial,radial)
      sense, not in a (meridional,normal) sense. At the bottom of
      p. P65 the directions of displacement components USTAR and
      WSTAR are shown, as well as CHI and V.  VSTAR is the same as V.

71.1  IVSTAR= circumferential displacement (0=free, 1=constrained)
72.1  IWSTAR=radial displacement(0=free,1=constrained,2=imposed)
73.1  ICHI=meridional rotation (0=free,1=constrained,2=imposed)
74.1  D1    = radial component of offset of ground support
74.2   
      See Fig. on page P69.

75.1  D2    = axial component of offset of ground support
80.1  Is this constraint the same for both prebuckling and buckling?
80.2   
      Different conditions may exist in the prebuckling phase from
      those in the buckling or vibration phase.  The most common
      case involves antisymmetric buckling or vibration at a
      symmetry plane.  A common oversight is the failure to run
      a case in which buckling and vibration modes are sought
      which are antisymmetric with respect to a structural plane
      of symmetry.  The user should check for modes both symmetrical
      and antisymmetrical at symmetry planes.

      If IUSTAR or IWSTAR or ICHI were 2 (imposed displacement), you
      must reset them in the bifurcation buckling analysis to either
      0 or 1  (probably 1, as an imposed displacement in the pre-
      buckling analysis implies no freedom of motion during buckling
      deformations).

81.1  IUSTARB= axial displacement for buckling or vibration phase
81.2   
      This and the following three items refer to the constraint
      conditions to be active during the bifurcation buckling
      or modal vibration phase of the analysis.  Apparently at
      least one of these conditions is different from what it
      is in the prebuckling analysis.

82.1  IVSTARB= circ. displacement for buckling or vibration phase
83.1  IWSTARB= radial displacement for buckling or vibration
84.1  ICHIB  = meridional rotation for buckling or vibration
86.1  Is this segment joined to any lower-numbered segments?
86.2   
      The segments are numbered 1, 2, . . .NSEG, in the order
      in which input data were provided for them.  We are
      concerned here only with those segments joined to the
      current segment and haviong preceeded it in the segment-
      by-segment input phase.

88.1  At how may stations is this segment joined to previous segs.?
88.2   
      Note that such junctions must be at intervals of at least 3
      nodal points, no closer.

90.1  INODE = node in current segment (ISEG) of junction, INODE
92.1  JSEG  = segment no. of lowest segment involved in junction
94.1  JNODE = node in lowest segment (JSEG) of junction
96.1  IUSTAR= axial displacement (0=not slaved, 1=slaved)
96.2   
      The nature of the juncture condition is governed by four
      integers, IUSTAR, IVSTAR, IWSTAR, and ICHI, which
      indicate whether USTAR, VSTAR, WSTAR, and CHI are not
      slaved or are slaved at the junction.  Most of the time you
      will supply the following input:

         IUSTAR = 1 (axial displacement u is slaved)
         IVSTAR = 1 (circumferential displacement v is slaved)
         IWSTAR = 1 (radial displacement w is slaved)
         ICHI   = 1 (meridional rotation CHI is slaved)

      Note that the constraints are applied in an (axial,radial)
      sense, not in a (meridional,normal) sense.
      See fig. at bottom of p. P65 and top of p. P69.
98.1  IVSTAR= circumferential displacement (0=not slaved, 1=slaved)

100.1 IWSTAR= radial displacement (0=not slaved, 1=slaved)
102.1 ICHI  = meridional rotation (0=not slaved, 1=slaved)
104.1 D1    = radial component of juncture gap
104.2  
      See figure on page P69.

106.1 D2    = axial component of juncture gap
108.1 Is this constraint the same for both prebuckling and buckling?
108.2  
      Different conditions may exist in the prebuckling phase from
      those in the buckling or vibration phase.  For example,
      we may want to simulate the development of a plastic hinge
      by using IUSTAR, IVSTAR, IWSTAR, ICHI = 1, 1, 1, 1  in the
      prebuckling analysis and 1, 1, 1, 0 in the buckling phase.

110.1 IUSTARB= axial displacement for buckling or vibration phase
110.2  
      This and the following three items refer to the constraint
      conditions to be active during the bifurcation buckling
      or modal vibration phase of the analysis.  Apparently at
      least one of these conditions is different from what it
      is in the prebuckling analysis.

111.1 IVSTARB= circ. displacement for buckling or vibration phase
112.1 IWSTARB= radial displacement for buckling or vibration
113.1 ICHIB  = meridional rotation for buckling or vibration
120.0   
      It may be necessary to provide additional constraint to
      ground in order to prevent rigid body motion in the
      bifurcation buckling phase of the analysis.  All possible
      types of rigid body motion are shown on p. P73. Rigid body
      motion corresponds to n = 0 or n = 1 circumferential waves.
      There is no rigid body component for any harmonic with n
      greater than or equal to 2.  Note that the following question
      applies only to the bifurcation buckling phase of the
      analysis, not to the axisymmetric prebuckling phase.
      
121.1 Given existing constraints, are rigid body modes possible?
121.2  
      Whether n=0 and/or n = 1 rigid body modes are possible
      or not depends on the constraints to ground that you have
      already supplied.  Please read p. P73 for examples of
      rigid body motion.

122.0   
      Please establish a location (segment no. and nodal point no.)
      at which to prevent rigid body motion.  This location must
      not correspond to a pole (a place where r=0).  It must corres-
      pond to one of the nodes involved in a "constraint-to-ground"
      condition. (For example, see the data labeled "extra condition"
      at the bottom of p. P75.)

      Note..Prevention of rigid body motion by means of the
      following data applies only to the bifurcation buckling
      phase of the analysis, not to the prebuckling phase.  You
      should have sufficient constraints to ground so that rigid
      body axisymmetric motion is not possible.  Please change
      your constraint conditions if prebuckling rigid body motion
      is possible.

123.1 ISEG  = segment no. at which to prevent rigid body motion
124.1 INODE = node no. at which to prevent rigid body motion
125.0  
      Rigid body motion for n = 0 and for n = 1 is prevented by
      assigning 1's to certain of the control integers, IUSTARB,
      IVSTARB, IWSTARB, and ICHIB. Which of these should be unity and
      which should be zero depends on your existing constraints to
      ground.  The usual practice is to assign IUSTARB=1, IVSTARB=1,
      IWSTARB = 0, and ICHIB = 0.

126.1 IUSTARB= axial n=0 rigid body constraint (0=none, 1=some)
126.2  
      IUSTARB should usually be set equal to 1 here.

127.1 IVSTARB=circ. n=0 rigid body constraint (usually equals 1)
128.1 IWSTARB=radial n=0 rigid body constraint (usually equals 0)
129.1 ICHIB = meridional rot. rigid body constraint
130.1 IUSTARB=axial n=1 rigid body constraint (usually equals 1)
131.1 IVSTARB=circ. n=1 rigid body constraint (usually equals 1)
132.1 IWSTARB=radial n=1 rigid body constraint (usually equals 0)
133.1 ICHIB = meridional rot. rigid body constraint

210.1 IPRINT = control (1 or 2 or 3) for list output
210.2  
      IPRINT = 1 means prebuckling states listed for selected
                 time steps;
      IPRINT = 2 means buckling modes printed for selected
                 circumferential wave numbers;
      IPRINT = 3 means both prebuckling states and buckling modes
                 printed for selected time steps and selected
                 circumferential wave numbers.

220.1 IPLOT  = control (0 or 1 or 2 or 3) for plot output
220.2  
      IPLOT  = 0 means no plots at all;
      IPLOT  = 1 means prebuckling states plotted for selected
                 time steps;
      IPLOT  = 2 means buckling modes plotted for selected
                 circumferential wave numbers;
      IPLOT  = 3 means prebuckling states and buckling modes
                 plotted for selected time steps and selected
                 circumferential wave numbers.

223.1 NLAST = plot options  (-1=none, 0=geometry, 1=u,v,w)
223.2   
      NLAST = -1 means no plotting;
               0 means plots of undeformed and deformed
                 geometry only;
               1 means plots of geometry and u,v,w vs arc length.

      Selection of output for axisymmetric prebuckling states...

230.1 NSTEPS = quantity of time steps for list or plot output
230.2  
      It is best to use a small number, such as 1, then look
      at the results before asking for more. If stresses and
      strains thru the thickness are desired, there is a lot
      of output for each time step.  We a referring to prebuckling
      states here, of course.

240.1 LSTEP(i)= output is desired for time step no.
250.1 TIME(i) = time corresponding to LSTEP
260.1 IFLAG = control (0 or 1) for amount of prebuckling output
260.2  
      IFLAG = 0 means that for each selected time step only the
                meridional distributions of displacements and
                stress resultants will be listed.
      IFLAG = 1 means that in addition, stresses and strains
                thru the thickness will be listed for each
                selected time step. (lots of output)

270.1 FMAX = normalization factor for plotting deformed shell
270.2  
      Good deformed shapes are obtained if the user sets FMAX
      equal to the largest normal displacement w encountered
      during the case.

271.1 Do you want prebuckling output for all the segments?
272.1 NSEG = total number of segments in the structure
273.1 Do you want any prebuckling output for segment no.
274.1 Do you want output for all nodal points in seg. no.
275.0  
      Range of nodal points for which you want output...

276.1 IMIN = minimum nodal point number for output, Seg.
277.1 IMAX = maximum nodal point number for output, Seg.

      Selection of buckling modes follows...

290.1 NMODES=quantity of buckling modes to be listed, plotted
290.2  
      One mode/circumferential wave number. You rarely need to
      see all of the modes calculated by the main processor; the
      critical mode is the most important, of course.

300.1 NTHMOD(i)=ith mode calculated in last main run. i=
300.2  
      Use the order in which the modes were calculated in the
      last run of the BOSOR5 main processor as a guide here,
      not the number of circumferential waves.  For example, if
      modes for circ. waves n = 5, 10, 15, 20 were calculated in
      that order, and you want to list and/or plot the modes
      corresponding to n = 5 and n = 15, then set NTHMOD(1) = 1
      (first mode calculated) and NTHMOD(2) = 3 (third mode
      calculated).

310.1 NWAVE(i)=no. of circ. waves in the ith mode. i=
310.2  
      In the above example NWAVE(1) = 5 and NWAVE(2) = 15.

320.1 Do you want buckling modal output for all the segments?
330.1 NSEG = total number of segments in the structure
340.1 Do you want any buckling modal output for segment no.
350.1 Do you want output for all nodal points in seg. no.
360.0  
      Range of nodal points for which you want buckling modes...
